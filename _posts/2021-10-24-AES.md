## SYMMETRIC CIPHERS

Symmetric-key ciphers are algorithms that use the same key both to encrypt and decrypt data. The goal is to use short secret keys securely and efficiently send long messages.

The most famous symmetric-key cipher is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), standardised in 2001. It;s sos widespread that modern processors even contain special instruction sets to perform AES operations. The first series of challenges here guides you through the inner workings of AES, showing you how its separate componentes work together to make it a secure cipher. By the end you will have built your own code for doing decryption ! 

We can split symmetric-key ciphers into two types, block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers break up a plaintext into fixed-length blocks, and send each block through an encryption function together with a secret key. Stream ciphers meanwhile encrypt one byte of plaintext at a time, by XORing a pseudo-random keystream with the data. AES is a block cipher but can be turned into a stream cipher using mode of operation such as CTR.

Block ciphers only specify how to encrypt and decrypt individual blocks, and a mod of operation must be used to apply the cipher to longer messages. This is the point where real world implementations often fail spectacularly, since developers do not understand the subtle implications of using particular modes. The remainder of the challenges see you attacking common misuses of various modes. 

------------------------------------
### HOW AES WORKS

#### KEYED PERMUTATIONS

AES, like all good block ciphers a "keyed permutation". This means that it maps every possible input block to a unique output block, with a key determining which permutation to perform.

Note: A "block" just refers to a fixed number of bits or bytes, which may represent any kind of data. AES processes a block and outputs another block. We'll be specifically talking the variant of AES which works on 128 bit (16 byte) blocks and a 128 bit key, knows as AES-128.

Using the same key, the permutation can be performed in reverse, mapping the output block back to the original input block. It is important that there is a one-to-one correspondence between input and output blocks, otherwise we wouldn't be able to rely on the ciphertext to decrypt back to the same plaintext we started with.

What is the mathematical term for a one-to-one orrespondence ?

Answer: bijection

#### RESISTING BRUTEFORCE

If a block cipher is secure, there should be no way for an attacker to distinggish the output of AES from a random permutation of bits. Furthermore, there should be no better way to undo the permutation than simply bruteforcing every possible key. That's why academics consider a cipher theoretically "broken" if they can find an attack that takes fewers steps to perform than bruteforcing the key, even if that attack is practically infeasible.

Note: How difficult is it to bruteforce a 128-bit keyspace ? Somebody estimated that if you turned the power of the entire Bitcoin mining network against an AES-128 key, it would take over a hundred times the age of the universe to crack the key.

It turns out that there is an attack on AES that's better than bruteforce, but only slightly - it lowers the security level of AES-128 down to 126.1 bits, and hasn't been improved on for over 8 years. Given the large "security margin" provided by 128 bits, and the lack of improvements despite extensive study, it;s not considered a credible risk to the security of AES. But yes, in a very narrow sense, it "breaks" AES.

Finally, while quantum computers have the potential to completely break popular public-key cryptosystems like RSA via Shor's algorithm, they are thought to only cut in half the security level of symmetric cryptosyste, via Grover's algorithm.  This is one reason why people recommend using AES-256, despite it being less performant, as it would still provide a very adequate 128 bits of security in a quantum future. 

What is the name for the best single-key attack againt AES ?

Answer: the meet-in-the-middle attack (MITM)

----------------------------------------------

#### STRUCTURE OF AES

To achieve a keyed permutation that is infeasible to invert without the key, AES applies a large number of ad-hoc mixing operations on the input. This is in stark contrast to public-key cryptosystems like RSA, which are based on elegant individual mathematical problems. AES is much kess elegant, but it's very fast. 

At a high level, AES-128 begins with a "key schedule" and then runs 10 rounds over a state. The starting state is just the plaintext block that we want to encrypt, represented as a `4x4` matrix of bytes. OVer the course of the 10 rounds, the state is repeatedly modified by a number of invertible transformations.

Note: Each transformation step has a defined purpose based on theoretical properties of secure ciphers established by Claude Shannon in the 1940s. We'll look closer at each of these in the following challenges.

Here's an overview of phases of AES encryption:

1. `KeyExpansion` or `Key Schedule`

From the 128 bit key, 11 separate 128 bit "round keys" are derived: one to be used in each `AddRoundKey` step.

2. `Initial key addition`

`AddRoundKey` - the bytes of the first round key are XOR's with the bytes of the state.

3. `Round` - this phase os looped 10 times, for 9 main rounds plus one "final round"

a) `SubBytes`-  each byte os the state is substituted for a different byte according to a lookup table ("S-box")

b) `ShiftRows` - the last three rows of the state matrix are transposed - shifted over a column or two or three

c) `MixColumn` - matrix multiplication is performed on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column. This is skipped in the final round.

d) `AddRoundKey` - the bytes of the current round key are XOR's with the bytes of the state.

Included is a `bytes2matrix` function for cinverting our initial plaintext block into a state matrix. Write a `matrix2bytes` function to turn that matrix backinto bytes, and submit the resulting plaintext as the flag.

This is my solution:

```py
def bytes2matrix(text):
    """ Converts a 16-byte array into a 4x4 matrix.  """
    return [list(text[i:i+4]) for i in range(0, len(text), 4)]

def matrix2bytes(matrix):
    """ Converts a 4x4 matrix into a 16-byte array.  """
    s=""
    for i in range(0,len(matrix)):
        tmp_list = matrix[i]
        for _ in tmp_list:
            s=s+chr(_)
    print("flag: ",s)
def test(matrix):
    print("len", len(matrix))

matrix = [
    [99, 114, 121, 112],
    [116, 111, 123, 105],
    [110, 109, 97, 116],
    [114, 105, 120, 125],
]

# print(matrix2bytes(matrix))
matrix2bytes(matrix)
# test(matrix)

```
~~~
flag: crypto{inmatrix}
~~~

------------------------------------------------

#### ROUNDS KEYS

We're going to skip over the finer details of the `KeyExpansion` phase for now. The main point is that it takes in our 16 bytes key and produces 11 `4x4` matrices called "round keys" derived from our initial key. These round keys allow AES to get extra mileage out of the single key that we provided.

The `initial ket addition` phase, which is next, has a single `AddRoundkey` step. The `AddRoundKey` step is straightforward: it XORs the current state with the current round key.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/l03kT0N.png)

`AddroundKey` also occurs á the final step of each round. `AddRoundKey` is what makes AES a "keyed permutation" rather than just a permutation. It's the only part of AES where the key i mixed into the state, but is crucial for determining the permutation that occurs.

As you've seen in previous challenges, XOR is an esaily invertible operation if you know the key, but tough to undo if you don't. Now imagine trying to recover plaintext which has been XOR'd with 11 different keys, and heavily jumbles between each XOR operation with a series of substitution and transposition ciphers. That's kinda what AES does ! Ans we'll see just how effective the jumbling is in the next few challenges.

Complete the `add_round_key` function, then use the `matrix2bytes` function to get your next flag.

This is my sol:

```py
state = [
    [206, 243, 61, 34],
    [171, 11, 93, 31],
    [16, 200, 91, 108],
    [150, 3, 194, 51],
]

round_key = [
    [173, 129, 68, 82],
    [223, 100, 38, 109],
    [32, 189, 53, 8],
    [253, 48, 187, 78],
]


def add_round_key(s, k):
    ss=""
    for i in range(0,4):
        for j in range(0,4):
            c = s[i][j] ^ k[i][j]
            ss = ss + chr(c)
    return ss

print(add_round_key(state, round_key))


```

~~~
Flag: crypto{r0undk3y}
~~~

---------------------------------------------------

The first step of each AES round is `SubBytes`. This involves talking each byte of the state matrix and substituting it for a different byte in a preset `16x16` lookup table. The lookup table is called a `Substitution box` or `S-box` for short, and can be perplexing at first sight. Let's break it down.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z9JjCHg.png)

In 1945 American mathematician Claude Shannon published a groundbreaking paper on Information Theory. It identified "confusion" as an essential property of a secure cipher. "Confusion" means that the relationship between the ciphertext and the key should be as complex as possible. Given just a ciphertext, there should be no way to learn anything about the key.

If a cipher has poor confusion, it is possible tp express a relationship between ciphertext, key, and plaintext as a linear function. For instance, in a Caesar cipher, `ciphertext = plaintext + key`. That's an obvious relation, which is easy to reverse. More complicated linear transformations can be solved using techniques like Gaussian elimination. Even low-degree polunomials, e.g. an equation like $x^4+51x^3+x$, can be solved efficiently using `algebraic methods`. However, the higher the degree of a polynomial, generally the harder it becoms to solve - it can only be approximated by a larger and larger amount of linear functions.

The main purpose of the S-box is to transform the input in a way that is resistant to being approximated by linear function. S-boxes are aiming for high non-linearity, and while AES's one is not perfect, it's pretty close. The fast lookup in an S-box is a shorcut for performing a very nonlinear function on the input bytes. This function involves taking the modular inverse in the `Galois field 2**8` and the applying an affine transformation which has been tweaked for maximum confusion. The simplest way to express the function is through the following high-degree polynomial:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YBHqw8r.png)

To make the S-box, the function has been calculated on all input value from `0x00` to `0xff` and the outputs put in the lookup table

Implement `sub_bytes`, sned the state matrix through the inverse `S-box` and then convert it to bytes to get the flag.

### DIFFUSION THROUGH PERMUTATION

We've seen how S-box substitution provides confusion. The other crucial property described by Shannon is "diffusion" [khuếch tán]. This relates to how every part of a cipher's input should spread to every part of the output.

Substitution on its own creates non-linearity, however it doesn't distribute it over the entire state. Without diffusion, the same byte in the same position would get the same transformations applied to it each round. This would allow cryptanalysts to attacj each byte position in the state matrix separately. We need to alternate substitution by scrambling the state (in an invertible way) so that substitutions applied on one byte influence all other bytes in the state. Each input into the next S-box then cecomes a function of multiple bytes, meaning that with every round the algebraic complexity of the system increases enormously.

Note: An ideal amount of diffusion causes a change of one bit in the pliantext to lead to a change in statiscally half the bits of the ciphertext. This desirable outcome is called the `Avalanche effect`

The `ShiftRows` and `MixColumns` steps combine to achieve this. They work together to ensure every byte affests other byte in the state within just two rounds.

`ShiftRows` is the most simple transformation in AES. It keeps the first row of the state matrix the same. The second row is shifted over one column to the left, wrapping around. The third row is shifted two columns, the fourth row by three. Wikipedia puts it nicely: "the importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers."

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0Yc9pJ0.png)

`MixColumns` is more complex. It performs Matrix multiplication in Rijndael's Galois fiels between the columns of the state matrix and a preset matrix. Each single byte of each column therefore affests all the bytes of the resulting column. The implementation details are nuancedl [this page](https://www.samiam.org/mix-column.html) and [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wikiRijndael_MixColumns) do a good job of covering them 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DR4KpMS.png)

We've provided code to perform `MixColumns` and the forward `ShiftRows` operation. After implementing `inv_shift_rows`, take the state, run `inv_mix_columns` on it, then `inv_shift_rows`, convert to bytes and you will have your flag.
