### Day 2. Interfaces and Cables 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vKY5rEe.png)

Đây là mặt trước của Switch

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kxr0Y2h.png)

Hắn có 24 interfaces, hay 24 cổng (port)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/x89q92U.png)

Đây là thông số của Swiches

Đừng lo lắng về những con số này, vì cuối video, chúng ta sẽ hiểu thôi mà

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NbP9CRc.png)

Nhìn vào những cái cổng trên, ta biết rằng, đó là những cổng RJ-45 (RJ = Registered Jack)

Những hình ảnh dưới đây là RJ-45 connectors

What is Ethernet ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8JVl1jE.png)

Why we need network protocols/standards ?

If two people are talking to each other, and one only speaks English, and the other only speaks Japanese, there's not going to be a much, or any, communication between them, what they need is some agreed upon system of communicating, like a common language between them, Network protocols serve that purpose for network devices, that's why standards like Ethernets exist. Since we're talking about interfaces and cables in this video, here's a more relevant example 

If you're trying to connect to, for example, a network switch, but the maker of the cable, and the maker of the switch haven't agreed upon size and shape of the connector and port, you won't be able to connect them. That's why there are industry standards that all vendors follow, both in terms of physical standards like connectors and cables, as well as logical standards, like IP, the internet protocol

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XiZOMTc.png)

Now, connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed

These speeds are measured in bits per second

What is a bit ?

Well it's a value represented by either a 0 or a 1

This binary code is how computers work

Youtube, this video, your operating system, all of it just a series of 0s and 1s which your computer interprets

When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in the electrical signal is interpreted by the receiving device as a 0 or a 1. So that's a bit, what's a byte ?

Here we have a series of 8 bits . 8 bits is equal to 1 byte 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/E8waGdS.png)

Now, speed is measured in bits per second

Imagine a byte, 8 bits, of data being sent along a wire, It reaches the neighboring device one bit at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z42CDXt.png)

It doesn't operate one byte at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9f8Z7Hu.png)

So, remember, speed is measured in bits per second, for example kilobits per second, megabits, 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPtHjCm.png)

Data on hard drive for example is measured in bytes, however, so remember a Gigabyte is actually 8 times larger than a gigabit, so let's review some of these measurements.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wxQW2Az.png)

Okay, finally lets talk about some Ethernet standards

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Jhjy8nR.png)

So, here's a table of some IEEE standards for copper Ethernet cables. We'll also take a look a fiber optic cables later in this lesson, but I decided to split them up. We have one for each of the common network cable speeds, 10 megabits per second, ... 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V6YTUdd.png)

UTP Cables 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z2jaJRa.png)

Full-Duplex transmission means that both devices and send data at the same time, and no problems like collisons will occur because they use separate wires to transmit and receive data. Just like that, both devices send data at the same time and there are no problem. Let's change the device on the left from a PC to a router. Just as a PC usually connects to a switch, a switch usually connects to a router , once again, it's a fastethernet, or 100BASE-T connection, so two pairs are used, 1 and 2, and 3 and 6

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4ec3S9J.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pEzVrAQ.png)

Now, in networks we don't always connect PC to switch, switch to router, what if we want to connect a router to another router ? Or maybe a switch to another switch ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Cbd1b76.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2MVN9qB.png)

While all of that is important information to know, and can cause issues in networks, even in the modern day, the truth is that most modertn networking devices have evolved beyond having to worry about straight-through or crossover cables. That's because newer networking devices include a feature called Auto MDI-X.

Previously, if two switches were connected with a straight-through cable like this, they would be unable to communicate. However, Auto MDI-X allows devices to automatically detect which pins their neighbor is transmitting data on, and then adjust which pins they use to transmit and receive data. They can then exchange data normally. So, unless you're working with network equipment that is quite old, you don't really have to worry about straight-through and crossover cables. But this is good information to be aware of, and it's also good to learn about the concept of auto MDI-X, both for the exam and for real world networking. So we've talked a lot about 10Base-T and 1000Base-T, but what about the higher speed copper ethernet cables ? Remember, I said before that gigabit ethernet and 10 gigabit ethernet, all 8 wires are used. The last two pairs are 4 and 5, and 7 and 8.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPgWXof.png)

Again, there will be flashcards to help you remember these details. It may seem like a lot to memorize, but if you use the flashcards properly its amazing how easy it is to remember all of these things. Now, here's another big difference between 1000BaseT and 10GBase-T, and 10Base-T and 100-BaseT. In addition to using all four pairs of wires, in 1000base-T and 10Gbase-T, each pair is bidirectional, meaning each pair isn't dedicated specifically to trasmitting data or receiving data. 

Each pair is bidirectional. This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds.

This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds

Okay, we've covered a lot about connections using copper UTP cables 

But there is a newer technology that is superior in many ways. For example, copper UTP wiring can be used for up to 100 meters. That's usually plenty within a LAN, but how about for larger networks ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gwif9C5.png)

Look at this Cisco switch here

Here it has 24 ports for RJ45 connectors. These are the ports you would connect a copper UTP cable to. But what about these four interfaces ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y8RfX5K.png)

But what about these four interfaces ?

Take a look at this Cisco router also It only has four RJ45 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Bk7sgZ.png)

The rest of them look like those other four ports on the switch 

In these interface you insert one of these. It's called an SFP transceiver. SFP means small form-factor pluggable. So you insert one of these into the device, but still things aren't complete.

What kind of cable connects to one of these ?

You connect one of these cables. This is a fiber optic cable. Rather than an electrical signal over copper wiring, these cables send light over glass fibers. Notice that there are two connectors on each end. That's because you need one connect to transmit data, and one to receive data, on each end. The copper UTP cables used separate wire pairs within the cable to transmit and receive data. The fiber-optic cables instead use separate cables to transmit and receive, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Jhc6IE.png)

Of course, 'transmit' on the left connects to 'receive' on the right, and 'transmit' on the right connects to 'receive' on the left. Now let's examine the structure of the cable itself.

There are four parts in this diagram, from the center to the outer layer.

Number 1 is the fiberglass core itself

Light is transmitted down this core to transmit data from one device to another

Number 2 is cladding that reflects light,

Number 3 is a protective buffer, which protects the fiberglass from breaking

And number four is the outer jacket of the cable

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PNqvxuD.png)

Now there are a couple main types of fiber-optic cables : Single-mode and multimode 

Let's check out their characteristics and differences 

These are two examples of multimode fiber cables 

The center represents the fiberglass core, and the blue represents the reflective cladding that reflects light down the cable
