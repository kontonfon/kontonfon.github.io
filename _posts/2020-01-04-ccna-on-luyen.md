Những hình ảnh dưới đây là RJ-45 connectors

What is Ethernet ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8JVl1jE.png)

Why we need network protocols/standards ?

If two people are talking to each other, and one only speaks English, and the other only speaks Japanese, there's not going to be a much, or any, communication between them, what they need is some agreed upon system of communicating, like a common language between them, Network protocols serve that purpose for network devices, that's why standards like Ethernets exist. Since we're talking about interfaces and cables in this video, here's a more relevant example 

If you're trying to connect to, for example, a network switch, but the maker of the cable, and the maker of the switch haven't agreed upon size and shape of the connector and port, you won't be able to connect them. That's why there are industry standards that all vendors follow, both in terms of physical standards like connectors and cables, as well as logical standards, like IP, the internet protocol

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XiZOMTc.png)

Now, connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed

These speeds are measured in bits per second

What is a bit ?

Well it's a value represented by either a 0 or a 1

This binary code is how computers work

Youtube, this video, your operating system, all of it just a series of 0s and 1s which your computer interprets

When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in the electrical signal is interpreted by the receiving device as a 0 or a 1. So that's a bit, what's a byte ?

Here we have a series of 8 bits . 8 bits is equal to 1 byte 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/E8waGdS.png)

Now, speed is measured in bits per second

Imagine a byte, 8 bits, of data being sent along a wire, It reaches the neighboring device one bit at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z42CDXt.png)

It doesn't operate one byte at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9f8Z7Hu.png)

So, remember, speed is measured in bits per second, for example kilobits per second, megabits, 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPtHjCm.png)

Data on hard drive for example is measured in bytes, however, so remember a Gigabyte is actually 8 times larger than a gigabit, so let's review some of these measurements.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wxQW2Az.png)

Okay, finally lets talk about some Ethernet standards

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Jhjy8nR.png)

So, here's a table of some IEEE standards for copper Ethernet cables. We'll also take a look a fiber optic cables later in this lesson, but I decided to split them up. We have one for each of the common network cable speeds, 10 megabits per second, ... 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V6YTUdd.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hNzGOkj.png)

UTP Cables 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z2jaJRa.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pObwDj3.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cgteOhz.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aXqxBFO.png)

Full-Duplex transmission means that both devices and send data at the same time, and no problems like collisons will occur because they use separate wires to transmit and receive data. Just like that, both devices send data at the same time and there are no problem. Let's change the device on the left from a PC to a router. Just as a PC usually connects to a switch, a switch usually connects to a router , once again, it's a fastethernet, or 100BASE-T connection, so two pairs are used, 1 and 2, and 3 and 6

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4ec3S9J.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pEzVrAQ.png)

Now, in networks we don't always connect PC to switch, switch to router, what if we want to connect a router to another router ? Or maybe a switch to another switch ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Cbd1b76.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2MVN9qB.png)

While all of that is important information to know, and can cause issues in networks, even in the modern day, the truth is that most modertn networking devices have evolved beyond having to worry about straight-through or crossover cables. That's because newer networking devices include a feature called Auto MDI-X.

Previously, if two switches were connected with a straight-through cable like this, they would be unable to communicate. However, Auto MDI-X allows devices to automatically detect which pins their neighbor is transmitting data on, and then adjust which pins they use to transmit and receive data. They can then exchange data normally. So, unless you're working with network equipment that is quite old, you don't really have to worry about straight-through and crossover cables. But this is good information to be aware of, and it's also good to learn about the concept of auto MDI-X, both for the exam and for real world networking. So we've talked a lot about 10Base-T and 1000Base-T, but what about the higher speed copper ethernet cables ? Remember, I said before that gigabit ethernet and 10 gigabit ethernet, all 8 wires are used. The last two pairs are 4 and 5, and 7 and 8.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPgWXof.png)

Again, there will be flashcards to help you remember these details. It may seem like a lot to memorize, but if you use the flashcards properly its amazing how easy it is to remember all of these things. Now, here's another big difference between 1000BaseT and 10GBase-T, and 10Base-T and 100-BaseT. In addition to using all four pairs of wires, in 1000base-T and 10Gbase-T, each pair is bidirectional, meaning each pair isn't dedicated specifically to trasmitting data or receiving data. 

Each pair is bidirectional. This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/U4aAAU0.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GUPKrsa.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eNAsz4U.png)

This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds

Okay, we've covered a lot about connections using copper UTP cables 

But there is a newer technology that is superior in many ways. For example, copper UTP wiring can be used for up to 100 meters. That's usually plenty within a LAN, but how about for larger networks ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gwif9C5.png)

Look at this Cisco switch here

Here it has 24 ports for RJ45 connectors. These are the ports you would connect a copper UTP cable to. But what about these four interfaces ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y8RfX5K.png)

But what about these four interfaces ?

Take a look at this Cisco router also It only has four RJ45 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Bk7sgZ.png)

The rest of them look like those other four ports on the switch 

In these interface you insert one of these. It's called an SFP transceiver. SFP means small form-factor pluggable. So you insert one of these into the device, but still things aren't complete.

What kind of cable connects to one of these ?

You connect one of these cables. This is a fiber optic cable. Rather than an electrical signal over copper wiring, these cables send light over glass fibers. Notice that there are two connectors on each end. That's because you need one connect to transmit data, and one to receive data, on each end. The copper UTP cables used separate wire pairs within the cable to transmit and receive data. The fiber-optic cables instead use separate cables to transmit and receive, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Jhc6IE.png)

Of course, 'transmit' on the left connects to 'receive' on the right, and 'transmit' on the right connects to 'receive' on the left. Now let's examine the structure of the cable itself.

There are four parts in this diagram, from the center to the outer layer.

Number 1 is the fiberglass core itself

Light is transmitted down this core to transmit data from one device to another

Number 2 is cladding that reflects light,

Number 3 is a protective buffer, which protects the fiberglass from breaking

And number four is the outer jacket of the cable

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PNqvxuD.png)

Now there are a couple main types of fiber-optic cables : Single-mode and multimode 

Let's check out their characteristics and differences 

These are two examples of multimode fiber cables 

The center represents the fiberglass core, and the blue represents the reflective cladding that reflects light down the cable 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TO0A40J.png)

----------------------------------------------------

#### LABS 02

PCs transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6

Switches are the opposite, they transmit data on pins 3 and 6 and receive data on pins 1 and 2

So, we can use a straight-through cable to connect all of these PCs, as well as SRV1, to the switches

Devices of the same type require crossover cables, or else the transmit pins will be connected to the transmit pins, and the receive pins will be connected to the receive pins, which will not allow data to be sent successfully between the devices

Next, let's connect these switches to the routers

Routers are like PCs, they transmit on pins 1 ans 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6 

So let's connect them to the switches with straight-through cables

So, I'll connect R2 to R1 with a crossover cable. R1 and R3 are 3 kilometers apart, so clearly, we will have to use a fiber-optic connection here, although packet tracer doesnt diffentiate between single-mode and multimode, which is appropriate here ? Well, multimode fiber allows distance up to 550 meters, which is more than UTP, but not enough for this connection. Single-mode allows much longer distances, 30 km, 40 km, even more, so in this case we would use single-mode fiber 

Finally, R3 and R4 are separated by 250 meters. That's too long for a UTP cable, but also not so long that we need single-mode fiber. A multimode fiber cable would be sufficient. Let's connect them together... Okay

That's all for this lab 


-----------------------------------------------------------------

#### Day 3. OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite

This third lesson is about two networking models

The first is the OSI Model, and the second is the TCP/IP suite

Note that the TCP/IP suite is a networking model, too, but it's usually referred as the TCP/IP suite, or just TCP/IP

Unless you're familiar with networking, you probably haven't heard of the OSI model.

However, you probably have heard of TCP/IP, or at least the second part of that name, IP, the Internet Protocol, for example you've probably heard of an IP address before. So, what is a networking model ?

Well, networking models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards 

Do you remember what a networking protocol is ?

I talked a bit about Ethernet, and various standards for copper and fiber-optic cables in the Day 2 video

That's an example of a protocol

A networking protocol is a set of rules defining how network devices and software should work, including how they should work together

By the way, protocols refer to logical rules about how devices should communicate, not physical standards.

So, you could visualize it like this

This is a networking model, and it categozies and provides a structure for various networking protocols like this

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Aowjai.png)

The different colors represent different categories of protocols and standards.

These protocols and standards could define something like the structure and usage of IP addresses, or maybe physical details like electrical voltage used on copper cables when transmitting data.

Let's talk about the OSI model first, and then we'll look at the TCP/IP suite after.

So, what if there were no standard networking models and protocols ?

Here's a few Dell PCs and a few iMacs 

If Dell and Apple each made their own networking model, each with own set of networking protocols, these Dells would be able to communicate with each other, and these iMacs would be able to communicate with each other, but because the Dells and IMacs would speek a different language than each other, with a different set of rules about how to communicate, the Dell wouldn't be to communicate with the imacs

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/grsEBZl.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nyjkB0h.png)

This is obviously a problem in modern networks, such as the Internet, where we expect devices from various makers in various countries to be able to communicate with each other. 

The OSI model is one attempt at standardizing network communications 

Although it isn't actually in use today, it has had a big impact on how network engineers think about networking, and we still refer to it today.

OSI stand for 'open system interconnection' model. Open, means that it is an open standard, not a proprietary model developed and used by an invidual company 

It is a conceptual model that categorizes and standardizes the different functions in a network.

It was created by the international organization for standardization, the ISO, in the late 1970s and early 1980s

Network functions are divided into 7 'layers'

From example, look at the bottom layer , layer 1.

It is the physical layer. The standards for cables and interfaces we learned about in the Day 2 video all fit into the physical layer of the OSI model, but there are 6 more layers on top of that to make the network operate properly .

Let's examine each layer one by one, starting at Layer 7, the application layer.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iBLge3s.png)

- This layer is closest to the end user

- The application layer interacts with software applications that have some communication component, such as your web browser, whether that's Brave, Firefox, Chrome, or whatever

- For example HTTP and HTTPs are Layer 7 protocols
(https://www.cisco.com)

Notice https before cisco.com, indicating that https is being used to get this website and view it in the browser

Keep in mind that Layer 7 doesn't include the application itself, like Chrome or Firefox, but rather the protocols that interact with the application, like http or https

- A couple functions of Layer 7 are: identifying communication partners and synchronizing communication

Let me explain how it does this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IN0tXtI.png)

Here I have two OSI model stacks, representing two computer that will communicate with eachother

The software application, maybe a web browser, interacts with Layer 7, the application layer, and wants to send some data to the system on the right.

This data is processed through the OSI stack, each layer adding something to the original 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ruVAGqZ.png)

This is called "encapsulation", because the original data is encapsulated inside this addiional information which is added on 

By the time it reaches the physical layer, it is electrical signals on a wire, and is sent to the neighboring system.

Then, the neighboring system performs the opposite process, the additionals of each layer are stripped off until the data reaches the application layer of the neighboring system 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MlPmFcW.png)

This process is called 'de-encapsulation', as the additional information is removed as the data is processed up the stack 

Both the encapsulation and de-encapsulation processes are examples of 'Adjacent-layer interaction', interaction between the different layers of the OSI model 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cvUlrsr.png)

However, the communication between the appication layers of the two different systems, is called same-layer interaction 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/h6E4bUq.png)

This same-layer interaction between application Layers is what allows the application layer to perform its functions of identifying communication partners, synchronizing communications, etc.

Layer 6 of the OSI is the presentation layer 

Data in the application is in an 'application format', a format that applications understand.

It needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network.

The presentation layer's job is to translate between application and network formats.

One example of a function of the presentation layer is encryption of data as it is sent,  so that only intended recipient can read it and of course decryption as it is received 

The presentation layer also translates between different application-layer formats, to ensure that the data is in a format the receiving host can understand. To summarize, the presentation layer translates data to the appropriate format. That's all you really need to know about the presentation layer.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0ImFLyJ.png)

Layer 5 of the OSI model is the session layer

The session layer controls dialogues, also known as sessions, between communicatings hosts. 

It establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the local application (for example your web browser) and the remote application, for example, Youtube

Youtube's servers  are being used by countless people at evert moment, and there has to be a way to manage all of these sessions. 

That's the purpose of the session layer of the OSI model 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TLJMQJT.png)

So, we've looked at the top 3 layers of the OSI model. From top to bottom, application, presentation, and session.

It's important to know what the functions of these layers are, but actually network engineers don't really work with these layers of the OSI model.

That is the job of application developers. 

Application developers work with the top layers of the OSI model to connect their applications over networks.

Let's return to this diagram

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OBQY7t0.png)

Remember what I said about encapsulation ?

Well, data prepared at the top 3 layers is then sent over to the bottom 4 layers, which actually do the work of sending it over the network. After the top 3 layer hand data over to the bottom 4 layers, the next step before sending is that Layer 4, the transport layer, adds a header in front of the data, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tgMfB1z.png)

So, let's look into the Transport layer a little bit

Layer 4 of the OSI model is the transport layer.

It segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts

To reword that, it breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur

For example, if data wasn't segmented and you were trying to watch a video, if an error occured that prevented the video from reaching your computer, you wouldn't be able to watch the video at all.

However, if the data is segmented into many small units, and only one fails to reach the destination, that's not a big problem. The video might skip for a second, but then will continue on just fine.

Also, the transport layer provides host-to-host communication, also known as end-to-end communication 

This also provide process-to-process communications for applications 

Not let's review 

Data is prepared by the top 3 layers 

a Layer 4 header is added on

Note that at this point in the process, this unit of data plus Layer 4 header is called a segment 

Remember, if the data being sent is large enough, it will actually be segmented into smaller parts, and a Layer 4 header will be added on to each segment.

Next, that segment is passed on to Layer 3 .

and another header is added on to the end, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XyZ5PET.png)

Layer 3 of the OSI model is the Network Layer 

The network layer provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks, for example ,

outside of the local area network, or LAN, which we mentioned briefly in the Day 1 video

Layer 3 provides logical addressing, in the form of IP addresses, something you've probably heard of before 

Layer 3 also provides path selection between source and destination 

Often there are many possible paths which which data can take to reach its destination, especially over a huge network like the Internet 

Layer 3 provides the means of selecting the best path

Routers operate at Layer 3

Remember in Day 1's video I said that routers are used when end hosts need to reach a destination outside of their LAN ?

That's because routers are Layer 3 devices. Let's view the encapsulation process again 

Data is prepared by the upper layers, the transport layer adds a layer 4 header, and this combination of data plus layer 4 header is called a segment, next the network layer adds a layer 3 header, including information like the source and destination IP address, to the segment. 

This combination of data, layer 4 header, and layer 3 header, is called a packet.

Next, the packet is further encapsulated at Layer 2, this time with both a Layer 2 header

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NfiVna0.png)

and a layer 2 trailer 

Layer 2 of the OSI model is the Data Link Layer 

The data link layer provides node-to-node connectively and data transfer 

For example, direct connections between a PC and a switch, or a switch and a router, or a router and a router. Because Layer 2 is adjacent to Layer 1, the physical layer, it also defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium, like copper UTP cables.

Layer 2 also detects, and possibly corrects, errors that occur on the physical layer 

Like layer 3, layer 2 also uses an addressing system, however it separate and different from layer 3 addressing. Finally, swiches operate at Layer 2.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qyf1Z2D.png)

Switches look at the destination Layer 2 address to determine where to send the data, let's look at the encapsulation process once more.

Data is prepared by the application layer 

A layer 4 header is added to the data to make a segment

A layer 3 header is added to the segment to make a packet

Remember, the IP address is included in this Layer 3 header.

Then, a layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer are added to the packet

At this point, the comnination of data, layer 4 header, layer 3 header, layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer is called a frame.

Now, the data is not further encapsulated at Layer 1. This frame is then sent over the connecion, whether it's electrical signals over a wire or wireless signals in the case of wifi, to the neighboring system

Let's look at layer 1 of the OSI model a bit before moving on

Layer 1 of the OSI model is the physical layer

The physical layer defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices

For example, voltages levels, maximum transmission distances, like the maximum cable lengths, mentioned in Day 2's video, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc..

Digital bits are converted into electrical signals, for wired connections, or radio signals, for wireless connections, like Wi-fi as I mentioned before, all of the information in Day 2'video, such as cables and pin layouts, is related to the physical layer of the OSI model. 

Okay, now we've got a complete frame, and that frame will be sent from the local device over this cable, let's say its an ethernet cable, 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ALRYZwH.png)

Once it reaches the remote device, the reverse process of encapsulation, de-encapsulation takes place, the data link layer translates the raw physical data into a complete frame once again


Then the layer 2 header and trailer are removed, leaving the layer 3 packet. 

The layed 3 header is removed, leaving the layer 4 segment.

Finally, the layer 4 header is removed and we are left with original data prepared by the upper layers of the ogirinal device

That's the process of de-encapsulation 

Before moving on, I want to review some terms

So, when an application wants to send data to another system, it interacts with the application layer of the OSI stack and the data is prepared to be sent.

When the layer 4 header is added at the transport layer, what is this combination of data plus . Layer 4 header called ?

It's called a Segment.

Then, the Layer 3 header is added on at the Network layer, remember that includes the IP address.

What's this now called ?

It's called a packet 

Finally, a Layer 2 header and trailer are added 

What's this complete unit called ? It's called a frame

Now, there is one new term that is used to refer to all of these 

These are all called Protocol Data Units or PDUs

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/G0EUFrr.png)

For example, segment is the term for a layer 4 PDU, packet is the term for a layer 3 PDU, etc.

By the way, at Layer 1, the physical layer, the name for for the PDU is bit, referring to the bits being transferred on the wire.

So, that's a lot of information 

If you need help remembering the order of the OSI model layers, the flashcards included in the description should be a big help, but here are a couple acronyms too. 

I don't use acronyms to remember things myself, but many people like them, so here are a few examples to help you remember 

The first one goes from layer 7 to layer 1, All People Seem To Need Data Processing.

Here's another one, from layer 1 to layer 7 this time, Please Do Not Teach Students PointLess Acronyms.

If you know any other good ones post them in the comment section !

Now let's move on from the OSI model, to the TCP/IP suite.

Like the OSI model, it is a conceptual model and set of communications protocols, and in TCP/IPs case it is used in the Internet and other networks.

It is known as TCP/IP because those are two of the foundational protocols in the suite.

It was developed by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA, which is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

It has a similar structure to the OSI model, but with fewer layers.

And, it is the model actually in use in modern networks, NOT OSI.

Note, however , that the OSI model still influences how network engineers think and talk about network today, which is why it's important to learn

Now, let's compare the two

On the left is the OSI model, you're familiar with by now, and on the right is the TCP/IP.

Suite's networking model.

The application,presentation,session layers of the OSI model are essentially equivalent to the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model.

Combining them into one actually represents how network engineers tend to think about networks, since we don't work much with anything above the Transport Layer, however, when talking about networks, we use the OSI numbering

For example, if you say 'there is a Layer 4 problem in the network', network engineers will think of OSI's Layer 4, the transport layer, not TCP/IP's Layer 4, the Application Layer of OSI's Layer 4, the transport layer, not TCP/IP's Layer 4, the Application Layer.

Moving on, the OSI model and the TCP/IP model both share the transport Layer.

The network layer of the OSI model maps to the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.

Finally, the data link and Physical layers of the OSI model are equivalent to the Link layer of the TCP/IP model.

Once again, though, if people say, for example, there is a Layer 2 problem in the network, they are referring to the OSI Model's Layer 2, the Data Link Layer, not TCP/IP's layer 2, the Internet Layer.

Keep that in mind 

Although TCP/IP is the model actually in use in modern day network, we still talk about networks using the OSI model language

Now, you might hear different names used for these layers.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dw63Zw8.png)

This is a chart off of Wikipedia showing different naming systems used.

Don't worry about memorizing all of these, but just keep in mind you might here different names than the ones I taught you 

For example, the Link layer might be called the network interface, or network access layer. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LqZZIIf.png)

I actually like this 5 layer model, because it combines the top 3 layers that we, network engineer, don't really think about into one, but it keeps the data link and physical layers separate, and I think its good to think of them as two separate layers.

Before finishing up this lesson and moving on to the quiz, I want to show you this excellent diagram which I found on Wikipedia.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EYho39g.png)

It demonstrates the process of a host, Host A, sending data to Host B, with two routers in between.

Here you see the four devices Host A, connected to A router, connected to another router, connected to Host B. Here is the TCP/IP stack on each device.

Note that, for forwarding data from host to host, these routers don't need to be aware of the higher layers, so only the Internet and Link layers are present here.

So, let's walk through the process.

An application on Host A wants to communicate with an application on Host B. Let's say it's a Skype conversation, so Host A is sending a little bit of video and audio data to Host B. Skype interacts with the application Layer, and the data is encapsulated via the Transport, Internet, and Link Layers, then, it is forwarded over to the Router, probably via Ethernet UTP copper cabling. Remember, Routers are layer 3 devices, so they want to know the Layer 3 IP address to know where to forward the data next.

So, de-encapsulation occurs at the Link layer, and then at the Internet Layer the router looks at the destination IP address to know where to send the packet.

Then, the packet is once again encapsulated to make a Frame. From here it is sent to another router, perhaps over long-distance fiber cabling.

At the link layer of this second router, de-encapsulation occurs again, and this router also checks the destination IP address 

Once it knows where to send the packer, it is once again encapsulated, and sent over some medium, Ethernet cabling in this case, to Host B. Now de-encapsulation takes place once more. Here at the link layer it is a frame. The header and trailer are removed, and it becomes a packet. 

The header is removed, and it becomes a segment

Finally, the transport layer header is removed, and the application layer on Host B receives the data and interacts with the application on Host B. So, this has achieved process-to-process communication, between Skype on Host A and Skype on Host B. Of course, this process will happen many many times in both directions during of duration of a skype call.

As I mentioned before, this is known as same-layer interaction. Also, I mentioned the transport layer providers host-to-host communication before. 

This diagram indicates that as well 

This transport layer segment was never changed during this whole process, it is as if it's direct communication between the two hosts 

Finally, remember that, because the TCP/IP protocols are all industry standard protocols used by all makers, it doesn't matter what kind of PCs or router you're using.

An Apple IMac can communicate with a Cisco router, which can communicate with a Juniper router, which can communicate with a Dell PC.

That's the importance of having industry standards.

Okay, that was another lesson with a lot of information.

Once again, there will be supplementary materials to help you remember everything 

There, will , of course, be an end-of-video quiz, coming up from the next slide.

There will also be premade flash cards to help you memorize what you need to remember, check the link the description.

Finally, for this video I will again include a Packet Tracer practice lab, which will use an interesting feature of packet tracer called 'simulation mode' to analyze network traffic.

Now let's go to the quiz

---------------------------------------------

### Lab 03 - OSI Model

In this lab we will examine some network traffic using packet tracer's simulation mode feature

But first, let's take a look at the network diagram

There are two routers, R1 and R2, two switches, SW1 and SW2, and one server and one PC

The G0/0,G0/1,G0/2 and F0/1 labels indicate the network interfaces used to connect the devices

G means gigabit ethernet, so these interfaces operate at a speed of one gigabit per second 

You might also see it written as Gi, or Gig, but I usually just use G.F means fastethernet, so these interfaces operate at 100 megabits per second. 

You might also see it written as Fa, instead of just F. Now these two series of numbers here, 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24, are network addresses.

Routers are used to connect different networks.

There are two networks displayed here in this diagram, the one on the left here includes SRV1, PC1, SW1,SW2 and R1's G0/0 interface

They are all in a single network, or subnet, a term you will learn about soon.

So, that's the 192.168.1.0/24 network, and the .100 for SRV1 means that its IP address is 192.168.1.100 and the .1 by R1 means that its address is 192.168.1.1

Wait for the lesson about IP addresses coming up soon for more information on this topic

The other network is 10.0.0.0/24, consisting of R1's G0/1 interface, and R2's G0/0

interface.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AVqEFgI.png)

Notice the .1 and .2, so R1 is 10.0.0.1 and R2 is 10.0.0.2

Hopefully that helps you understand a little bit about how to read a network diagram

Don't worry if you have no idea how IP addresses work, or what that /24 next to the network addresses means, that will all be explained in a video coming soon.

So let's get started on today's main topic

I'm going to use packet tracer's simulation mode, which you can activate here, in the bottom right.

Now, I can click through here, and you can see various network traffic being sent around.

Let's take a look at some.

At Device SW2 means that SW2 is the one sending out the data, it says, STP 

STP is spanning-tree protocol, a layer 2 protocol you'll learn a lot about in this course. Let's click on it, and notice that the 7 layers of the OSI model, and STP has information in the bottom two

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iNsUMPY.png)

Let's look at the Layer 2 header

Notice it says Layer 2: IEEE 802.3 header.

You might remember that IEEE 802.3 is the standard number for Ethernet, so this is an Ethernet Layer 2 header.

Let's look at some of the information here. 

Down here it shows some information about the process, and notice here at number 2: The device encapsulates the PDU into an Ethernet frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c6sqW8r.png)

There's the encapsulation process I talked about in the lecture video.

Let's take a look at the Layer 1 info

Notice that the information is the two interfaces that it sends the frame out of.

Information like the physical ports, or interfaces, on a device are Layer 1 information, because it is the physical layer.

Now let's look at another bit of network traffic, this time AT device R1, and the type is OSPF

OSPF is a layer 3 protocol, it's used to discover the best paths to different network.

You'll learn a lot about it, too, in this course.

STP only had layer 2 and layer 1 information, but OSPF has layer 3, layer 2, and Layer 1.

Notice in the Layer 3 header, source IP address, and destination IP address.

Remember, IP addresses are layer 3 information.

Next, to look at some traffic that includes information all the way up to Layer 7, I will go on PC1.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yhzHMhF.png)

PC1 is using a protocol called DHCP to automatically receive an IP address 

To generate some DHCP traffic, and DHCP is a layer 7 protocol, I'll get PC1 to release its current IP address, and then renew it

When you click on a PC in packet tracer you'll see this screes.

Click on desktop, then command prompt, to access the PC's command prompt, which functions like a windows command prompt.

Type ipconfig, and you can see the current IP address here ... to release the IP address, type ipconfig /release.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FTsRssQ.png)

And now you can see already a DHCP message on PC1

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VnEYeQX.png)

I'll type the next command to, to renew the IP address 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OqHuubs.png)

Now let's check one of these DHCP messages.

Notice information all the way up to Layer 7, except layers 5 and 6.

That's because in the TCP/IP model, which is the model actually in use, layers 5,6 and 7 are all combined into a single layer called the application layer, so you're not going to see any layer 5 or 6 information, but you can consider it to be part of the layer 7 information.

Then there is layer 4 information, if you click on it, it says the device encapsulates the PDU into a UDP segment, remember the Layer 4 PDU is called a segment.

Layer 3, Layer 2, and Layer 1 information is present as well.

Now, if I just press the play button in the middle, it will slowly play through all of the different messages being sent through the network.

That's all for this lab, I just wanted to show you the OSI and TCP/IP models at work on a network.

Your understanding of the functions of these layers might still be a little unclear, but trust me, you'll understand things better as we start to actually learn about these diffrent protocols that operate at each layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 4. Intro to the CLI

In this fourth lesson, we will finally get started actually configuring some Cisco devices.

This lesson is about the Cisco IOS CLI

Cisco IOS is the operating system used on Cisco devices, like Windows on a PC, or macOS on an imac.

Keep in mind, Cisco's IOS is not related to Apple's iOS for iPhones.

Now, what is a CLI ?

CLI stands for command-line interface 

It's the interface you use to configure Cisco devices, like routers, switches, and firewalls.

Here's an image of the Cisco IOS CLI

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vWdIlNK.png)

The color scheme can be changed, this is just the default color scheme with the software

I used when taking this screenshot.

Now, there is also something called a GUI, which means graphical user interface.

Here's an example of a Cisco GUI, from Cisco's ASDM which can be used to configure Cisco's Firewalls.

However, we won't cover GUIs in this course, and most network engineers prefer to use the CLI over a GUI.

Now, how exactly do you connect to a Cisco device to configure it with the CLI ?

There are a couple methods, but I'm going to talk about connecting via the console port.

Connecting to a device via the console port typically involves bringing your laptop to the device and connecing to the console port of the device. There are also methods to connect to a device remotely, but we'll cover that later

In any case, when you first configure a device, you have to connect to the console port

This is an image of a Cisco catalyst switch, and notice the two console ports.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vgavMl6.png)

one of them is an RJ45 port, just like the switch's network ports

The other is a USB mini-b-connector.

You can connect to either of these, but let's say we're going to connect to the RJ45 port.

You're going to need the proper cable.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JqTwAnl.png)

This is the kind of cable you will use

Notice one end has an RJ45 connector, just like the Ethernet UTP cables we looked at.

The other end is a D89 connector.

However, most laptops these days no longer have a serial port to plug the cable into

So you'll probably need an adapter, like this, to connect to a USB port on your laptop.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lpMpmo1.png)

The actual name of the cable on the left is 'rollover cable'

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HbJ5a96.png)

The name is similar to crossover cable, but it's different than an Ethernet UTP

Like is an Ethernet UTP cables, there are 8 pins on each end that are used.

However, they connect like this: pin 1 to pin 8, pin 2 to pin 7, pin 3 to pin 6, pin 4 to pin 5, pin 5 to pin 4, pin 6 to pin 3,pin 7 to pin 2, and pin 8 to pin 1.

So, once you've connected your computer to the device, how do actually access the CLI ?

Well, you need to use a terminal emulator, this one here, PuTTy, is a popular choice. 

You can get it at putty.org.select serial, here, and then click open and you should be connected to the CLI

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/84QTOIg.png)

You should be able to connect with the default settings, but click serial down here, and you can view and edit the default settings for the serial connection. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TKsTNyN.png)

Note that these settings match the defaults on Cisco devices, so you'll probably never have to change them, but it's good to be aware of them, and try to remember them for the test.

The speed, also known as baud ratem is 9600 bits per second.

There are 8 data bits and 1 stop bit

Understanding data bits and stop bit is outside of the scope of the CCNA, but basically it means that for each 8 bits of data one stop bit is sent, to mark the end of the 8 bits. Parity is set to none.

Parity is used to detect errors.

And finally, flow control is set to none.

Flow control is exactly what it sounds like, controlling the flow of data from transmitter to receiver, but again you don't have to worry about the details for the exam.

Just remember Cisco's defaults

Speed of 9600 bits per second, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control.

Once you connect to the device, you will be greeted with a screen like this.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vRy9LmB.png)

Since this is the first time booting up the devices, I am asked if I would like to enter the initial configuration dialog, and I answer no. Then I pressed the enter key to get started, and I'm now free to type commands into the CLI.

When you first enter the CLI, you will by default be in what's called 'user EXEC mode'

User EXEC mode is indicated by the 'greater than sign' next to the host name of the device. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/17vyWWh.png)

Note that the dedault host name for this device is 'Router'

The text displayed here always indicates the hostname of the device

All devices have a hostname, and for a Cisco router the default name is Router.

User EXEC mode is very limited.

Users can look at some things, but can't make any changes to the configuration.

Usually you don't do anything in this mode 

You also might hear it called just 'user mode'

So, let's move to a mode with a little more power to make changes to the device

If you enter the 'enable' command in user EXEC mode, you will be placed in privileged exec mode

In privileged exec mode, a pound sign, or hashtag, whatever you want to call, it displayed

Privileged EXEC mode provides complete access to view the device's configuration, restart the device, etc

This is not the mode in which you actually change the configuration, however you can change the time on the device, and also save the current configuration file, among many other things.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TQOuO3y.png)

This is a comparison of the command available in user EXEC mode, on the left, and privileged EXEC mode, on the right.

Also, I'm taking these screenshots from Cisco Packet Tracer software.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tyJ1s2n.png)

Packet Tracer is a network simulator.

It is a fantastic resource for the CCNA, but it is limited beyond the CCNA.

There are many things which Packet Tracer doesn't support, so if I were to show these commands on a real device, you would probably see even more commands available here.

I want to repeat, however, that Packet Tracer is an excellent resource for the CCNA and you don't really need to use anything else for your CCNA.

One more thing, notice the command I used to view the available commands.

You can use a question mark to view the commands that are available to you.

Now I want to show you a convenient feature of the CLI

That is the tab key

In the sample output here, notice the first line says en, the second says enable, and then I entered privileged exec mode.

Well, if you press tab, the CLI will automatically complete the word for you, and display the complete word on a new line

However, another convenient thing is that you don't even need to complete the command 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Mozs8vg.png)

Here i just typed 'en', and hit enter, and I was brought to privileged EXEC mode. This can really save you a lot of typing when you're entering many commands.

There are limits to this, however Although 'en' was enough for the router to understand that I meant to use the command 'enable', that's because it's the only command that begins with EN that can be entered in user EXEC mode. If i type just 'e', however, we are told that it is an ambiguous command. That's because there's more than one command that begins with e.

How can we view the commands that begin with e ?

Well, remember the question mark from before ?

If i type e, followed by a question mark, it displays the possible commands that begin with e.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Q4N1w1Y.png)

There are two, enable and exit, so if I type just 'e' and hit enter, the router doesn't know which command I want to use

So, the shortest form of the enable command is 'en'

And, the shortest form of the exit command is 'ex'

Now let's actually make some changes to the router's configuration

To do so, we enter 'global configuration mode'

The command to enter configuration mode is configure terminal

When in global configuration mode, config is inserted after the hostname

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y9UG7kd.png)

Once again, you don't have to type the whole word

Notice I type con, followed by the question mark , and there are two option, configure and connect .

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/36lQJuO.png)

So, the shortest possible command for configure is conf, c-o-n-f

However, terminal is the only option beginning with T, so all I need to type CONF T to enter global configuration mode.

From now on, in all of my lab demonstrations and such, I will probably be typing conf t instead of configure terminal

Try to remember that the full command is configure terminal, but also feel free to use the shortcuts.

Now, we don't want just anyone to be able to make changes to the network configuration, or even able to just look at the configuration, because that could be a security risk.

We can protect privileged exec mode with a password, so that if a user enters the 'enable' command from user EXEC mode, they are asked for the password 

That is done with the command 'enable password' in global configuration mode  

First, i want to clarify the use of the question mark 

Notice that I used the question mark with no space after password

here is the output 

If you use the question mark with no space, it shows you all possible completions of that word

I already typed the full word password, so it just displays the word again, and there are no other words that begin with p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d

Next I used the question mark again, this this time with a space after password 

Notice the difference in the output

This time it shows all possible options we could enter next in the command 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/D4DQSRc.png)

In this case, I used the middle one

Notice that LINE is in all capital letters

That means that you don't actually type LINE, you type a line which will become the password

I typed CCNA in all capitals as the password 

Note that Password ARE case-sensitive, so CCNA in capital letters and ccna in lower-case letters different passwords

Once again I typed the question mark to check if there are any further options.

This cr means that there are no further options, the only option is to press enter to enter the command 

I pressed enter, and now the password is set.

Let's test it

So, let's test out our password

I type exit to return to privileged EXEC mode. 

From privileged exec mode, if I type exit again I am logged out of the device and see the starting screen again.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8XKrGbK.png)

If I press enter here

I am brought back to user exec mode

If I enter the enable command, I am asked for a password. No password displays here, but i am brought to priveleged exec mode

That's because the password does not display as you type it, for security purposes.

Also, note that if you enter the wrong password 3 times, you will denied access for having bad screts 

I think everyone has bad secrets of some kind, but in this case it means an incorrect password 

Let's review what we've done so far 

In my experience it was difficult to get used to operating in the CLI when I first started learning, so we'll take it slow and review along the way.

Also, make sure to check out the next video after you finish this, which will have you doing these same tasks in packet tracer.

Hands-on practice is absolutely essential to get comfortable with the CLI

So, I use the enable command to enter privileged exec mode, From privileged exec mode, I use configure terminal to enter global configuration mode.

In global configuration mode, I use the command enable password CCNA to protect privileged exec mode with a password

Remember, this password is case-sensitive. Then I type exit to return privileged exec mode and exit again to return user exec mode. I type enable again then I enter the password, which isn't displayed as I type it, and I am brought back into privileged 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4d0krvN.png)

We confirmed the function of the password, but let's take a look at the configuraion file itself to check it

First I want to explain the two configuration files kept on the device. As I said, there are two separate configuration files kept on the device at once 

One is the running-config. This is the current, active configuration file on the device. As you enter commands in the CLI, you edit the active configuration 

The startup-config is the configuration file that will loaded upon restart of the device 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/i3oLthF.png)

If you reload the device, or shut it down and then turn it on later, the startup-config will be loaded.

So let's take a look at the configuration files 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3IdPtfh.png)

Use the 'show running-config' command in global configuration mode to view the running configuration file. 

There is lots of data in the file by default so I only included the output up to the command we entered.

Here's the command, enable password CCNA, in the running-config 

How about the startup-config ?

You can view it with the show startup-config command, however as you can see, at this point it just displays the message 'startup-config' is not present.

This is because we haven't saved the running configuration yet, so every time we restart the router it will load a default configuration, not the startup-configuration. 

Let's save the configuration file 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BKAGvqr.png)

There are actually three ways you can save the running-configuration, to make it the startup-configuration 

All three of these commands are executed from privileged exec mode.

The first is 'write'

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XzAc2Wi.png)

It says building configuration, and then an OK message to indicate that the configuration was saved.

The second method is write memory, it performs the same function.

The third command is copy running-config startup-config

This tells the router to copy the running-config file to the startup-config file, again performing the same function as the previous two commands.

Now if use the show startup-config command again, it displays the same configuration as the show running-config command.

Once again, however, this is only the beginning of the output, there is more below.

We'll check it out in the packet tracer lab video coming up text.

Now, you can see the enable password right here, in plain text.

This is a security risk, because anyone who simply takes a glance at this password knows how to get into privileged exec mode, and then global configuration mode to make changes to the device.

Let's level up the security a bit.

You can do so with the 'service password-encryption' command in global configuration mode.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k1S0kEG.png)

Notice I used the short version of configure terminal, conf t, to enter global configuration mode. Remember that all of these commands have shortcuts. I'll usually use the full command for these instructional videos, but in the labs when I enter the commands live you'll see me using shortcuts a lot.

Any way, the service password-encryption command will encrypt all passwords in a jumble of numbers and letters, so that they cannot be easily read.

If I enter the show running-config command again, notice that the password 'CCNA' has become 08026F6028

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CrWioFs.png)

The password itself hasn't changed, it is still CCNA, only the way it is displayed in the configuration has changed.

Also, you may notice that a 7 has appeared before the password. This number '7' indicates the type of encryption used to encrypt the password. The number 7 means it is using Cisco's proprietary encryption algorithm, from the service password-encryption command. 

Later in this video, you will see another number in that place .

While using the 'service password-encryption' command is more secure than not using it, it's still not very secure.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LCjgVxT.png)

In this screenshot I simply searched for a cisco type 7 password cracker on google [Link](https://www.ifm.net.nz/cookbooks/passwordcracker.html), found this website, and was able to crack the password in a few seconds.

The good news, though, is that there is a more secure enable password that can be used on Cisco devices, with a tougher type of encryption. The more secure method is to use the enable secret command, instead of the enable password command

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MtGT8uj.png)

This time I used a password of Cisco, with an upper-case C. Once again, this is case-sentitive.

Then I view the running configuration once more.

However, since I was still in global configuration mode, I typed 'do' in the front of the command.

This is a convenient trick that allows you to execute privileged exec mode commands like show running-config or show startup-config, in other configuration levels.

Also notice I used shortcuts, sh instead if show and run instead of running-config.

Now you can see the enable secret in the running-configuration.

~[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MC2JtIs.png)

Notice the number 5 before the encrypted password .

Number 5 indicates MD5 type encryption, which is much more secure than what we got with the service password-encryption command.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CUE7lKt.png)

It can still be cracked, no password is invicible, but its much better.

Also notice that the enable password command remains, it isn't replaced.

However, if both the enable secret and enable password commands are configured, the enable password will be ignored, only the enable secret will be valid.

One final note, the 'service password-encryption' command has NO effect on the enable secret command.

The enable secret is always encrypted, wheather or not you entered the service password-encryption command.

So, really you should always use the enable secret, instead of the enable password, as it is more secure.

Now I want to show you one more thing in the CLI before we move on to the quiz for today's video. 

That is , how you cancel, or delete, a command that you entered.

That is done by typing 'no' in front of the command.

For example, if I type 'no' in front of the service password encryption command, future passwords will no longer be encrypted.

However, as you can see here, passwords which are already encrypted will NOT be decrypted by disabling service password-encryption.

If I enter a new password, however, it will be in clear text, NOT encrypted.

So, let me summarize the service-password encryption command.

If you enable service password-encryption current passwords will be encrypted, future passwords will also be encrypted. 

Once again, however, the enable secret will not be affected, it is always ecrypted.

If you disable service password-encryption current passwords will not be decrypted, they will remain encrypted. Future passwords will not be encrypted, they will remain in clear-text.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/P0xwCXh.png)

The enable secret will not be effected, once again it is always encrypted.

Let's review all of the commands and such we learned in this lesson.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UxkCEX4.png)

 First, the different modes of the Cisco CLI we looked at today.

 Router> ----- = user EXEC mode.

 Router# ----- = privileged EXEC mode

 Router(config)# = global configuration mode

 Finally is global configuration mode, indicated by config in brackets, plus the hashtag.

 ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Xnap3Kh.png)

 Now let's review some commands.

 Router>enable

 ## used to enter privileged exec mode

 Router# configure terminal

 Router(config)# enable password password

 ## configures a password to protect privileged exec mode

 ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ynRvmi8.png)

 Router(config)# service password-encryption

 ## encrypts the enable password (and other passwords)

 Router(config)# enable secret password

 ## configures a more secure, always-encrypted enable password.

 Router(config)# run privileged-exec-level-command

 ## executes a privileged-exec level command from global configuration mode

 ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sOV77n4.png)

Router(config)# no command

## removes the command

Router(config)# show running-config

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Device Security - Day 4 Lab

In this lab, we'll finally get hands on in the Cisco IOS CLI, the command line interface.

If you're already watched the Day 4 lecture video, you should be able to complete these tasks on your own.

Even if you can, I recommand watching this video after to check and get any additional explanations.

So, we've got a small network here with a few PCs, and switch, and a router.

Our tasks involve some basic configurations on the router and switch.

For this video, I will only configure the router.

However, I recommend that you go through the steps on both devices.

Repetition is essential to get used to all the commands you need to know, so remember to configure both devices.

Step 1 is to set the approriate host name for each device, R1 and SW1.

We didn't cover the command in the main video, but to do so you use the 'hostname' command in global configuration mode.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZV0gkNR.png)

Now, in the lecture video, I explained about how to connect to the console port of a device.

In packer tracer, you can actually do that, connect a PC to the console port of the device and then use the PC to do the configurations. However, simply clicking on the device itself is much more convenient, so that's what we'll be doing for these labs. Just keep in mind that in real life, you can't configure the device directly on the device itself, you have to connect to it with a computer. The current hostname for each device is displayed here.

As you can see, by default the hostname is router. To change the hostname, we must enter 'Global configuration' mode.

However to get there, we must first enter 'Privileged exec' mode.

This is achieved by using the 'enable' command. 

To demonstrate a shortcut, I will use the 'exit' command to return to the previous exec mode.

Notice that you can enter privileged exec mode by simply typing 'en' and then use tab to auto-complete it to 'enable', but this isn't necessary.

'en' alone is fine.

'e', however, is too short, and we are told this is an ambiguous command. This is because there are other potential commands that begin with 'e', which we can see by tying 'e' and then a question mark.

As you can see, there are two potential commands; enable and exit.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oPzyCCv.png)

So, if you just enter 'e', the router doesn't know which command you mean.

However, 'enable' is the only command beginning with 'en', so 'en' is all the router needs to know which command you mean.

Now that we are in privileged exec mode, we can use the 'configure terminal' command to get to 'global configuration' mode.

If you want to use shortcuts again as we did with enable and 'en', the shortest version of the 'configure terminal' command is 'conf t'.

From here we can set the hostname of the router.

This is done with the hostname command.

I will enter 'hostname' R1

Step 2 is to set the uncrypted enable password on each router to CCNA

The 'enable password' is used to privileged exec mode, which is also called enable mode.

Previously we had no password set, so we were able to hear privileged exec mode without any password.

Now we are going to protect privileged exec mode so that only administrators can access it.

The command is simple, and it done in 'global configuration' mode, which we are already in.

Type 'enable password CCNA'.

Now let's test it out, which is step 3

From here  I will use exit command twice, once to bring me back to privileged exec mode.

and then once again to bring me back to user exec mode.

Now I will use the enable command again, however this time I am asked for a password.

The character do not appear as I type, however if I type the password 'CCNA' correctly and press enter I am brought to privileged exec mode.

Now let's see what happens if I fail to enter the correct password.

I enter the wrong password once, twice, and then three times before being rejected for having 'bad secret'.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ubHf6OE.png)

Now I will try again with the correct password, and I'm in

Step 3 is now complete.

Step 4 is simply to view the password in the running configuration.

The running configuration is the current active configuration of the router, whether or not you have actually saved it.

If you turn off the router without saving the running configuration you will lose any changes.

If you want to keep your changes you have to save them to the startup configuration.

To view the running configurationm, use the show running-config command from privileged exec mode, which we are already in.

You can abbreviate it too, for example sh run.

As you can see it is not encrypted, it is written in clear text right.

Let's solve that in step 5.

So step 4 is now complete.

Step 5 is to enable password encryption on the device.

We can protects passwords by encrypting them to render them unreadable.

This is done from global configuration mode with the command 'service password-encryption'

Okay, that's all for step 5

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/g8ruYCq.png)

Step 6 is to once again view the running config

I will use the same command as before, and now lets check the password.

However the command doesn't work

That is because we are currently in global configuration mode, and show running-config must be entered from privileged exec mode.

Now, I could type exit to drop back to privileged exec mode and then enter the command.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MHQFJNX.png)

But there is no more way, which I demonstrated in the lecture video.

If I type 'do' in front of the command, I can enter it from global configuration mode.

'do sh run (do show running-config)'. There we go.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MHQFJNX.png)

You can see here 'enable password', followed by a 7 and then a string of other numbers.

The password has successfully been encrypted.

Although we didn't type this 7 when we entered the command, it refers to the type of encryption used.

There are other types as well.

The string of numbers that follow are the password 'CCNA', encrypted to be unreadable so that anyone looking over out shouder can't read the password.

Keep in mind that the encryption used in the 'service password-encryption' isn't vety secure and can be cracked, but this at least renders the password safe from someone simply glancing over your shoulder.

Step 6 is now complete.

Step 7 is to configure a more secure, encrypted enable password of 'Cisco'.

That can be DONE with the 'enable secret' command.

The enable secret uses MD5 encryption, which is more secure that what you get with the service password-encryption command.

Since we're already in global configuration mode, let's enter the command.

Enable secret Cisco.

Now let's go on Step 8, which is to exit back to user EXEC mode and try to login.

Okay, now let's try to get back to privileged EXEC mode.

Let's try our original password of 'CCNA' .. it doesn't work anymore

How about our newly configired enable secret ?

As you can see, if both an enable secret and enable password are configured, only the enable secret can be used.

The enable password becomes invalid

Step 9 is to once again view the passwords in the running configuration

Show running - config

There they are

Once again, the enable password with service password-encryption uses type 7 encryption, indicated by this 7 here.

The enable secret uses type 5 encryption, which is MD5 encryption.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mZ7devz.png)

Step 10 is to save the running configuration to the startup configuration.

There are threes way to do this

One is write ... another is write memory ... and the third is copy running-config startup-config.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/r6ZOsFA.png)

There's the config, and you can see the passwords we configured here.

If I scroll through you can see lots of other default settings for the device here.

Step 10 is now complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 1)

This is the fifth lesson, and now we're going to get more into the details of how data travels through a network.

This time we'll focus on Ethernet LAN switching, So if we look simple network consisting of a few PCs, a switch, and a router, connected to the Internet, today we'll be looking at how data moves around between the switches and the end hosts connected to them, and to their router.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ueX3iWL.png)

How data is sent from the router to other networks will be a topic for another video, but let's start small.

First let's review

This is slide from Day 3's video of describing the physical layer of OSI model, The physical layer defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices.

For example voltage levels, maximum transmission distances (like Ethernet UTP cables' 100 meter limit), physical connectors, cable specifications, etc.

Digitals bits are converted into electrical (for wired connections) or radio(for wireless connections) signals.

All of the information in Day 2's video (cables,pin layouts) is related to the Physical Layer.

So, we've covered a good amount about the physical layer, learning about cropper UTP cables, fiber-optic cables, RJ45 connectes, etc.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HbIfzCm.png)

Let's go review this silde about Layer 2, the Data Link layer, from Day 3's video.

Layer 2 provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer, for example PC to switch, or switch to router, or router to router, etc,...It defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (for example, copper UTP cables) 

It detects and possibly corrects Physical Layer errors.

It uses layer 2 addressing, which is separate from Layer 3 addressing.

Remember IP, IP address are Layer 3 addresses, not Layer 2

Switches operate at Layer 2.

So, in this video we'll be talking about Ethernet LAN switching, and Ethernet involves Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model.

Since we've already covered the Layer 1 Ethernet standards like UTP cables, this video will be about Layer. Then, as we continue with this series, we'll move up the layers of the OSI model, until you get a complete image of how data is sent and received over networks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tXkMSp9.png)

Now, let's talk about what a LAN, or Local Area Network is.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bAxZhX5.png)

There are different ways of defining a LAN, and your understanding of a LAN will become more complete as you learn more and more about networking.

But basically, it's a network contained within a relatively small area, like an office floor, or your home network.

Routers are used to connect separate LANs.

Looking at this diagram, how many LANs do you think there are ?

Well, by the definition I'm using, this green network, consisting of three PCs, one switch, and the router interface they are connect to, is one LAN. This red network is also one LAN. Although there are two switches, it is all one LAN.

Swithces do not separate LANs, but adding more switches can be used to expand an exsiting LAN.

So these red devices are part of one large LAN.

Now, what do you think about the blue devices ?

There's the same devices as in the red network, but instead of the switches being connected to each other, they are connected to different router interfaces.

So, that means they are two separate LANs. One for this switch, it's end hosts and their router interface, and one for this switch, it's end hosts, and the router interface they connect to.

So, in this lesson we'll look at at how traffic is sent and received within LANs like these, for example this PC in LAN 2 to another PC in LAN. But, we'll leave the topic of sending data between LANs for a later video.

Here's one more bit of review.

This shows the encapsulation process as data is prepared to be sent over a network.

At the top, the data prepared by the upper layers of the OSI model is simply called data.

A layer 4 header is added, and this combination of data and layer 4 header is called a segment.

A layer 3 header is added to the segment, and it is now called a packet.

Finally, a Layer 2 header and trailer are added to the packet, and it becomes a frame

Once again, these different stages of preparing data to be forwarded are called 'protocol data units' or PDUs. For example, the Layer 2 PDU is a frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cs2NHQk.png)

Today we're going to focus on how switches receive and forward frames, specifically Ethernet frames. Since it's the layer 2 protocol used in virtually every LAN in existence today.

Let's take a look at the actual contents of this Ethernet header and trailer.

So, here's an Enthernet frame, encapsulating the packet with a header and trailer.

Note that I put the header on the left and the trailer on the right, opposite of previous slide

Let's look at the header.

Don't worry, I'll cover these in more detail, but here's a quick rundown

There are five fields in the header. First, the preamble and SFD, which means start frame delimeter, these are used for synchronization and to allow the receiving device to be prepared to receive the rest of the data in the frame. 

Next is the destination,the Layer 2 address to which the frame is being sent , next is the source, the Layer 2 address of the device which sent the frame. The final field in the Ethernet header is the type.

It indicates the Layer 3 protocol used in the encapsulated Packet, which is almost always Internet Protocol, or IP, or IP version 6.

However, sometimes this is a length field, indicating the length of of the encapsualted data, depending on the version of Ethernet.

Now, the Ethernet trailer has only one field . That's is FCS, which stands for frame check sequence. It's used by the receiving device to detect any errors that might occurred in transmission.

Okay, now let's take a look at these fields in more detail, starting with the preamble and start frame delimeter

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/59eqivQ.png)

Here are the first two fields, the Preamble and SFD, which I like to think of as a set. Let's look at the preamble first. It's 7 bytes long. How many bits is that ? 

If you remember, there are 8 bits in 1 bute, so , 7 times 8 is equal to 56 bits

It's a series of alternating 1s and 0s. Like this 10101010 * 7 , which is one bytem seven times

The purpose of this is that it allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks, to make sure they're ready to receive the rest of the frame and the data inside. 

Okay, that's the preamble, now the SFD.

SFD stands for 'start frame delimeter' It's length 1 byte, or 8 bits.

It's bit pattern is 10101011, similar to each byte of the preamble but the last bit is a 1, not a 0. 

It indicates the end of preamble and the begining of the rest of the frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/G9kg41R.png)

Now let's look at the next two fields, the destination and source fields.

They indicate the devices sending and receiving the frame, like when you send an email both the destination and source email address are included in the email, or when you send a letter in the mail, although that's getting less and less common these days.

The addresses used in Ethernet are the destination and source 'MAC addresses'

MAC stands for media access control.

The MAC address is a 6-byte, or 48 bit, address of the physical device.

This is separate from a logical address like an IP address, the MAC address is actually assigned to the device when it is made.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4BwJe63.png)

I'll talk more about MAC addresses in a few slides, but let's move on to the remaining fields of the Ethernet frame.

The last field of the Ethernet header is the Type or Length field.

It is 2-bytes, or 16-bits, in length.

It can be used to represent either the type of the encapsulated packet, or the length of the encapsulated packet.

What do I mean by that ?

Well, if the value in the field is 1500 or less, that means it is indicating of the LENGTH of the encapsulated packet in bytes.

For example, if the value in this field is 1400, it means that the encapsualted packet is 1400 bytes in length. However, a value of 1536 or greater in this field indicates the TYPE of the encapsulated packet, which is usually internet protocol version 4 or version 6, and then the length is determined via other methods.

For example, a value of 0x0800, which is written in hexadecimal, and is equal to 2048 in decimal

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/p1WXy85.png)

The 0x in front of 0800 is used to indicate hexadecimal, by the way. I'll talk more about hexadecimal in a few slides when I talk in detail about MAC addresses.

2048 is greater than 1536, of course, and its used to identify that the encapsulated packet is an IPv4 packet.

0x86DD, which is equal to 34525 in decimal, is used to indicate that the encapsulated packet is an IPv6

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4Y8gT8q.png)

Okay, so those are all of the fields in an Ethernet header.

Try to remember the lengths of each field 

Now let's take a brief look at the only field of the Ethernet trailer, the FCD, or frame check sequence 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7W01GdC.png)

The only field of the Ethernet trailer is the FCS, which as I mentioned stands for frame check sequece.

'Frame Check Sequence'.

It is 4 bytes ,or 32-bits in length.

It's purpose is to detect corrupted data by running a 'CRC' algorithm over the received data

CRC means cyclic redundancy check.

Cyclic refers to something called 'cyclic codes', 'redundancy' refers to the fact that these 4 bytes at the end of the message enlarge the message without adding any new information, so they are redundant and check refers to the fact that is CHECKS, or verifies, the data for errors.
