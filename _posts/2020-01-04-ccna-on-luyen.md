Những hình ảnh dưới đây là RJ-45 connectors

What is Ethernet ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8JVl1jE.png)

Why we need network protocols/standards ?

If two people are talking to each other, and one only speaks English, and the other only speaks Japanese, there's not going to be a much, or any, communication between them, what they need is some agreed upon system of communicating, like a common language between them, Network protocols serve that purpose for network devices, that's why standards like Ethernets exist. Since we're talking about interfaces and cables in this video, here's a more relevant example 

If you're trying to connect to, for example, a network switch, but the maker of the cable, and the maker of the switch haven't agreed upon size and shape of the connector and port, you won't be able to connect them. That's why there are industry standards that all vendors follow, both in terms of physical standards like connectors and cables, as well as logical standards, like IP, the internet protocol

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XiZOMTc.png)

Now, connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed

These speeds are measured in bits per second

What is a bit ?

Well it's a value represented by either a 0 or a 1

This binary code is how computers work

Youtube, this video, your operating system, all of it just a series of 0s and 1s which your computer interprets

When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in the electrical signal is interpreted by the receiving device as a 0 or a 1. So that's a bit, what's a byte ?

Here we have a series of 8 bits . 8 bits is equal to 1 byte 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/E8waGdS.png)

Now, speed is measured in bits per second

Imagine a byte, 8 bits, of data being sent along a wire, It reaches the neighboring device one bit at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z42CDXt.png)

It doesn't operate one byte at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9f8Z7Hu.png)

So, remember, speed is measured in bits per second, for example kilobits per second, megabits, 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPtHjCm.png)

Data on hard drive for example is measured in bytes, however, so remember a Gigabyte is actually 8 times larger than a gigabit, so let's review some of these measurements.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wxQW2Az.png)

Okay, finally lets talk about some Ethernet standards

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Jhjy8nR.png)

So, here's a table of some IEEE standards for copper Ethernet cables. We'll also take a look a fiber optic cables later in this lesson, but I decided to split them up. We have one for each of the common network cable speeds, 10 megabits per second, ... 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V6YTUdd.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hNzGOkj.png)

UTP Cables 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z2jaJRa.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pObwDj3.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cgteOhz.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aXqxBFO.png)

Full-Duplex transmission means that both devices and send data at the same time, and no problems like collisons will occur because they use separate wires to transmit and receive data. Just like that, both devices send data at the same time and there are no problem. Let's change the device on the left from a PC to a router. Just as a PC usually connects to a switch, a switch usually connects to a router , once again, it's a fastethernet, or 100BASE-T connection, so two pairs are used, 1 and 2, and 3 and 6

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4ec3S9J.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pEzVrAQ.png)

Now, in networks we don't always connect PC to switch, switch to router, what if we want to connect a router to another router ? Or maybe a switch to another switch ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Cbd1b76.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2MVN9qB.png)

While all of that is important information to know, and can cause issues in networks, even in the modern day, the truth is that most modertn networking devices have evolved beyond having to worry about straight-through or crossover cables. That's because newer networking devices include a feature called Auto MDI-X.

Previously, if two switches were connected with a straight-through cable like this, they would be unable to communicate. However, Auto MDI-X allows devices to automatically detect which pins their neighbor is transmitting data on, and then adjust which pins they use to transmit and receive data. They can then exchange data normally. So, unless you're working with network equipment that is quite old, you don't really have to worry about straight-through and crossover cables. But this is good information to be aware of, and it's also good to learn about the concept of auto MDI-X, both for the exam and for real world networking. So we've talked a lot about 10Base-T and 1000Base-T, but what about the higher speed copper ethernet cables ? Remember, I said before that gigabit ethernet and 10 gigabit ethernet, all 8 wires are used. The last two pairs are 4 and 5, and 7 and 8.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPgWXof.png)

Again, there will be flashcards to help you remember these details. It may seem like a lot to memorize, but if you use the flashcards properly its amazing how easy it is to remember all of these things. Now, here's another big difference between 1000BaseT and 10GBase-T, and 10Base-T and 100-BaseT. In addition to using all four pairs of wires, in 1000base-T and 10Gbase-T, each pair is bidirectional, meaning each pair isn't dedicated specifically to trasmitting data or receiving data. 

Each pair is bidirectional. This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/U4aAAU0.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GUPKrsa.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eNAsz4U.png)

This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds

Okay, we've covered a lot about connections using copper UTP cables 

But there is a newer technology that is superior in many ways. For example, copper UTP wiring can be used for up to 100 meters. That's usually plenty within a LAN, but how about for larger networks ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gwif9C5.png)

Look at this Cisco switch here

Here it has 24 ports for RJ45 connectors. These are the ports you would connect a copper UTP cable to. But what about these four interfaces ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y8RfX5K.png)

But what about these four interfaces ?

Take a look at this Cisco router also It only has four RJ45 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Bk7sgZ.png)

The rest of them look like those other four ports on the switch 

In these interface you insert one of these. It's called an SFP transceiver. SFP means small form-factor pluggable. So you insert one of these into the device, but still things aren't complete.

What kind of cable connects to one of these ?

You connect one of these cables. This is a fiber optic cable. Rather than an electrical signal over copper wiring, these cables send light over glass fibers. Notice that there are two connectors on each end. That's because you need one connect to transmit data, and one to receive data, on each end. The copper UTP cables used separate wire pairs within the cable to transmit and receive data. The fiber-optic cables instead use separate cables to transmit and receive, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Jhc6IE.png)

Of course, 'transmit' on the left connects to 'receive' on the right, and 'transmit' on the right connects to 'receive' on the left. Now let's examine the structure of the cable itself.

There are four parts in this diagram, from the center to the outer layer.

Number 1 is the fiberglass core itself

Light is transmitted down this core to transmit data from one device to another

Number 2 is cladding that reflects light,

Number 3 is a protective buffer, which protects the fiberglass from breaking

And number four is the outer jacket of the cable

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PNqvxuD.png)

Now there are a couple main types of fiber-optic cables : Single-mode and multimode 

Let's check out their characteristics and differences 

These are two examples of multimode fiber cables 

The center represents the fiberglass core, and the blue represents the reflective cladding that reflects light down the cable 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TO0A40J.png)

----------------------------------------------------

#### LABS 02

PCs transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6

Switches are the opposite, they transmit data on pins 3 and 6 and receive data on pins 1 and 2

So, we can use a straight-through cable to connect all of these PCs, as well as SRV1, to the switches

Devices of the same type require crossover cables, or else the transmit pins will be connected to the transmit pins, and the receive pins will be connected to the receive pins, which will not allow data to be sent successfully between the devices

Next, let's connect these switches to the routers

Routers are like PCs, they transmit on pins 1 ans 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6 

So let's connect them to the switches with straight-through cables

So, I'll connect R2 to R1 with a crossover cable. R1 and R3 are 3 kilometers apart, so clearly, we will have to use a fiber-optic connection here, although packet tracer doesnt diffentiate between single-mode and multimode, which is appropriate here ? Well, multimode fiber allows distance up to 550 meters, which is more than UTP, but not enough for this connection. Single-mode allows much longer distances, 30 km, 40 km, even more, so in this case we would use single-mode fiber 

Finally, R3 and R4 are separated by 250 meters. That's too long for a UTP cable, but also not so long that we need single-mode fiber. A multimode fiber cable would be sufficient. Let's connect them together... Okay

That's all for this lab 


-----------------------------------------------------------------

#### Day 3. OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite

This third lesson is about two networking models

The first is the OSI Model, and the second is the TCP/IP suite

Note that the TCP/IP suite is a networking model, too, but it's usually referred as the TCP/IP suite, or just TCP/IP

Unless you're familiar with networking, you probably haven't heard of the OSI model.

However, you probably have heard of TCP/IP, or at least the second part of that name, IP, the Internet Protocol, for example you've probably heard of an IP address before. So, what is a networking model ?

Well, networking models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards 

Do you remember what a networking protocol is ?

I talked a bit about Ethernet, and various standards for copper and fiber-optic cables in the Day 2 video

That's an example of a protocol

A networking protocol is a set of rules defining how network devices and software should work, including how they should work together

By the way, protocols refer to logical rules about how devices should communicate, not physical standards.

So, you could visualize it like this

This is a networking model, and it categozies and provides a structure for various networking protocols like this

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Aowjai.png)

The different colors represent different categories of protocols and standards.

These protocols and standards could define something like the structure and usage of IP addresses, or maybe physical details like electrical voltage used on copper cables when transmitting data.

Let's talk about the OSI model first, and then we'll look at the TCP/IP suite after.

So, what if there were no standard networking models and protocols ?

Here's a few Dell PCs and a few iMacs 

If Dell and Apple each made their own networking model, each with own set of networking protocols, these Dells would be able to communicate with each other, and these iMacs would be able to communicate with each other, but because the Dells and IMacs would speek a different language than each other, with a different set of rules about how to communicate, the Dell wouldn't be to communicate with the imacs

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/grsEBZl.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nyjkB0h.png)

This is obviously a problem in modern networks, such as the Internet, where we expect devices from various makers in various countries to be able to communicate with each other. 

The OSI model is one attempt at standardizing network communications 

Although it isn't actually in use today, it has had a big impact on how network engineers think about networking, and we still refer to it today.

OSI stand for 'open system interconnection' model. Open, means that it is an open standard, not a proprietary model developed and used by an invidual company 

It is a conceptual model that categorizes and standardizes the different functions in a network.

It was created by the international organization for standardization, the ISO, in the late 1970s and early 1980s

Network functions are divided into 7 'layers'

From example, look at the bottom layer , layer 1.

It is the physical layer. The standards for cables and interfaces we learned about in the Day 2 video all fit into the physical layer of the OSI model, but there are 6 more layers on top of that to make the network operate properly .

Let's examine each layer one by one, starting at Layer 7, the application layer.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iBLge3s.png)

- This layer is closest to the end user

- The application layer interacts with software applications that have some communication component, such as your web browser, whether that's Brave, Firefox, Chrome, or whatever

- For example HTTP and HTTPs are Layer 7 protocols
(https://www.cisco.com)

Notice https before cisco.com, indicating that https is being used to get this website and view it in the browser

Keep in mind that Layer 7 doesn't include the application itself, like Chrome or Firefox, but rather the protocols that interact with the application, like http or https

- A couple functions of Layer 7 are: identifying communication partners and synchronizing communication

Let me explain how it does this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IN0tXtI.png)

Here I have two OSI model stacks, representing two computer that will communicate with eachother

The software application, maybe a web browser, interacts with Layer 7, the application layer, and wants to send some data to the system on the right.

This data is processed through the OSI stack, each layer adding something to the original 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ruVAGqZ.png)

This is called "encapsulation", because the original data is encapsulated inside this addiional information which is added on 

By the time it reaches the physical layer, it is electrical signals on a wire, and is sent to the neighboring system.

Then, the neighboring system performs the opposite process, the additionals of each layer are stripped off until the data reaches the application layer of the neighboring system 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MlPmFcW.png)

This process is called 'de-encapsulation', as the additional information is removed as the data is processed up the stack 

Both the encapsulation and de-encapsulation processes are examples of 'Adjacent-layer interaction', interaction between the different layers of the OSI model 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cvUlrsr.png)

However, the communication between the appication layers of the two different systems, is called same-layer interaction 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/h6E4bUq.png)

This same-layer interaction between application Layers is what allows the application layer to perform its functions of identifying communication partners, synchronizing communications, etc.

Layer 6 of the OSI is the presentation layer 

Data in the application is in an 'application format', a format that applications understand.

It needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network.

The presentation layer's job is to translate between application and network formats.

One example of a function of the presentation layer is encryption of data as it is sent,  so that only intended recipient can read it and of course decryption as it is received 

The presentation layer also translates between different application-layer formats, to ensure that the data is in a format the receiving host can understand. To summarize, the presentation layer translates data to the appropriate format. That's all you really need to know about the presentation layer.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0ImFLyJ.png)

Layer 5 of the OSI model is the session layer

The session layer controls dialogues, also known as sessions, between communicatings hosts. 

It establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the local application (for example your web browser) and the remote application, for example, Youtube

Youtube's servers  are being used by countless people at evert moment, and there has to be a way to manage all of these sessions. 

That's the purpose of the session layer of the OSI model 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TLJMQJT.png)

So, we've looked at the top 3 layers of the OSI model. From top to bottom, application, presentation, and session.

It's important to know what the functions of these layers are, but actually network engineers don't really work with these layers of the OSI model.

That is the job of application developers. 

Application developers work with the top layers of the OSI model to connect their applications over networks.

Let's return to this diagram

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OBQY7t0.png)

Remember what I said about encapsulation ?

Well, data prepared at the top 3 layers is then sent over to the bottom 4 layers, which actually do the work of sending it over the network. After the top 3 layer hand data over to the bottom 4 layers, the next step before sending is that Layer 4, the transport layer, adds a header in front of the data, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tgMfB1z.png)

So, let's look into the Transport layer a little bit

Layer 4 of the OSI model is the transport layer.

It segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts

To reword that, it breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur

For example, if data wasn't segmented and you were trying to watch a video, if an error occured that prevented the video from reaching your computer, you wouldn't be able to watch the video at all.

However, if the data is segmented into many small units, and only one fails to reach the destination, that's not a big problem. The video might skip for a second, but then will continue on just fine.

Also, the transport layer provides host-to-host communication, also known as end-to-end communication 

This also provide process-to-process communications for applications 

Not let's review 

Data is prepared by the top 3 layers 

a Layer 4 header is added on

Note that at this point in the process, this unit of data plus Layer 4 header is called a segment 

Remember, if the data being sent is large enough, it will actually be segmented into smaller parts, and a Layer 4 header will be added on to each segment.

Next, that segment is passed on to Layer 3 .

and another header is added on to the end, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XyZ5PET.png)

Layer 3 of the OSI model is the Network Layer 

The network layer provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks, for example ,

outside of the local area network, or LAN, which we mentioned briefly in the Day 1 video

Layer 3 provides logical addressing, in the form of IP addresses, something you've probably heard of before 

Layer 3 also provides path selection between source and destination 

Often there are many possible paths which which data can take to reach its destination, especially over a huge network like the Internet 

Layer 3 provides the means of selecting the best path

Routers operate at Layer 3

Remember in Day 1's video I said that routers are used when end hosts need to reach a destination outside of their LAN ?

That's because routers are Layer 3 devices. Let's view the encapsulation process again 

Data is prepared by the upper layers, the transport layer adds a layer 4 header, and this combination of data plus layer 4 header is called a segment, next the network layer adds a layer 3 header, including information like the source and destination IP address, to the segment. 

This combination of data, layer 4 header, and layer 3 header, is called a packet.

Next, the packet is further encapsulated at Layer 2, this time with both a Layer 2 header

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NfiVna0.png)

and a layer 2 trailer 

Layer 2 of the OSI model is the Data Link Layer 

The data link layer provides node-to-node connectively and data transfer 

For example, direct connections between a PC and a switch, or a switch and a router, or a router and a router. Because Layer 2 is adjacent to Layer 1, the physical layer, it also defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium, like copper UTP cables.

Layer 2 also detects, and possibly corrects, errors that occur on the physical layer 

Like layer 3, layer 2 also uses an addressing system, however it separate and different from layer 3 addressing. Finally, swiches operate at Layer 2.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qyf1Z2D.png)

Switches look at the destination Layer 2 address to determine where to send the data, let's look at the encapsulation process once more.

Data is prepared by the application layer 

A layer 4 header is added to the data to make a segment

A layer 3 header is added to the segment to make a packet

Remember, the IP address is included in this Layer 3 header.

Then, a layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer are added to the packet

At this point, the comnination of data, layer 4 header, layer 3 header, layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer is called a frame.

Now, the data is not further encapsulated at Layer 1. This frame is then sent over the connecion, whether it's electrical signals over a wire or wireless signals in the case of wifi, to the neighboring system

Let's look at layer 1 of the OSI model a bit before moving on

Layer 1 of the OSI model is the physical layer

The physical layer defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices

For example, voltages levels, maximum transmission distances, like the maximum cable lengths, mentioned in Day 2's video, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc..

Digital bits are converted into electrical signals, for wired connections, or radio signals, for wireless connections, like Wi-fi as I mentioned before, all of the information in Day 2'video, such as cables and pin layouts, is related to the physical layer of the OSI model. 

Okay, now we've got a complete frame, and that frame will be sent from the local device over this cable, let's say its an ethernet cable, 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ALRYZwH.png)

Once it reaches the remote device, the reverse process of encapsulation, de-encapsulation takes place, the data link layer translates the raw physical data into a complete frame once again


Then the layer 2 header and trailer are removed, leaving the layer 3 packet. 

The layed 3 header is removed, leaving the layer 4 segment.

Finally, the layer 4 header is removed and we are left with original data prepared by the upper layers of the ogirinal device

That's the process of de-encapsulation 

Before moving on, I want to review some terms

So, when an application wants to send data to another system, it interacts with the application layer of the OSI stack and the data is prepared to be sent.

When the layer 4 header is added at the transport layer, what is this combination of data plus . Layer 4 header called ?

It's called a Segment.

Then, the Layer 3 header is added on at the Network layer, remember that includes the IP address.

What's this now called ?

It's called a packet 

Finally, a Layer 2 header and trailer are added 

What's this complete unit called ? It's called a frame

Now, there is one new term that is used to refer to all of these 

These are all called Protocol Data Units or PDUs

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/G0EUFrr.png)

For example, segment is the term for a layer 4 PDU, packet is the term for a layer 3 PDU, etc.

By the way, at Layer 1, the physical layer, the name for for the PDU is bit, referring to the bits being transferred on the wire.

So, that's a lot of information 

If you need help remembering the order of the OSI model layers, the flashcards included in the description should be a big help, but here are a couple acronyms too. 

I don't use acronyms to remember things myself, but many people like them, so here are a few examples to help you remember 

The first one goes from layer 7 to layer 1, All People Seem To Need Data Processing.

Here's another one, from layer 1 to layer 7 this time, Please Do Not Teach Students PointLess Acronyms.

If you know any other good ones post them in the comment section !

Now let's move on from the OSI model, to the TCP/IP suite.

Like the OSI model, it is a conceptual model and set of communications protocols, and in TCP/IPs case it is used in the Internet and other networks.

It is known as TCP/IP because those are two of the foundational protocols in the suite.

It was developed by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA, which is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

It has a similar structure to the OSI model, but with fewer layers.

And, it is the model actually in use in modern networks, NOT OSI.

Note, however , that the OSI model still influences how network engineers think and talk about network today, which is why it's important to learn

Now, let's compare the two

On the left is the OSI model, you're familiar with by now, and on the right is the TCP/IP.

Suite's networking model.

The application,presentation,session layers of the OSI model are essentially equivalent to the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model.

Combining them into one actually represents how network engineers tend to think about networks, since we don't work much with anything above the Transport Layer, however, when talking about networks, we use the OSI numbering

For example, if you say 'there is a Layer 4 problem in the network', network engineers will think of OSI's Layer 4, the transport layer, not TCP/IP's Layer 4, the Application Layer of OSI's Layer 4, the transport layer, not TCP/IP's Layer 4, the Application Layer.

Moving on, the OSI model and the TCP/IP model both share the transport Layer.

The network layer of the OSI model maps to the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.

Finally, the data link and Physical layers of the OSI model are equivalent to the Link layer of the TCP/IP model.

Once again, though, if people say, for example, there is a Layer 2 problem in the network, they are referring to the OSI Model's Layer 2, the Data Link Layer, not TCP/IP's layer 2, the Internet Layer.

Keep that in mind 

Although TCP/IP is the model actually in use in modern day network, we still talk about networks using the OSI model language

Now, you might hear different names used for these layers.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dw63Zw8.png)

This is a chart off of Wikipedia showing different naming systems used.

Don't worry about memorizing all of these, but just keep in mind you might here different names than the ones I taught you 

For example, the Link layer might be called the network interface, or network access layer. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LqZZIIf.png)

I actually like this 5 layer model, because it combines the top 3 layers that we, network engineer, don't really think about into one, but it keeps the data link and physical layers separate, and I think its good to think of them as two separate layers.

Before finishing up this lesson and moving on to the quiz, I want to show you this excellent diagram which I found on Wikipedia.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EYho39g.png)

It demonstrates the process of a host, Host A, sending data to Host B, with two routers in between.

Here you see the four devices Host A, connected to A router, connected to another router, connected to Host B. Here is the TCP/IP stack on each device.

Note that, for forwarding data from host to host, these routers don't need to be aware of the higher layers, so only the Internet and Link layers are present here.

So, let's walk through the process.

An application on Host A wants to communicate with an application on Host B. Let's say it's a Skype conversation, so Host A is sending a little bit of video and audio data to Host B. Skype interacts with the application Layer, and the data is encapsulated via the Transport, Internet, and Link Layers, then, it is forwarded over to the Router, probably via Ethernet UTP copper cabling. Remember, Routers are layer 3 devices, so they want to know the Layer 3 IP address to know where to forward the data next.

So, de-encapsulation occurs at the Link layer, and then at the Internet Layer the router looks at the destination IP address to know where to send the packet.

Then, the packet is once again encapsulated to make a Frame. From here it is sent to another router, perhaps over long-distance fiber cabling.

At the link layer of this second router, de-encapsulation occurs again, and this router also checks the destination IP address 

Once it knows where to send the packer, it is once again encapsulated, and sent over some medium, Ethernet cabling in this case, to Host B. Now de-encapsulation takes place once more. Here at the link layer it is a frame. The header and trailer are removed, and it becomes a packet. 

The header is removed, and it becomes a segment

Finally, the transport layer header is removed, and the application layer on Host B receives the data and interacts with the application on Host B. So, this has achieved process-to-process communication, between Skype on Host A and Skype on Host B. Of course, this process will happen many many times in both directions during of duration of a skype call.

As I mentioned before, this is known as same-layer interaction. Also, I mentioned the transport layer providers host-to-host communication before. 

This diagram indicates that as well 

This transport layer segment was never changed during this whole process, it is as if it's direct communication between the two hosts 

Finally, remember that, because the TCP/IP protocols are all industry standard protocols used by all makers, it doesn't matter what kind of PCs or router you're using.

An Apple IMac can communicate with a Cisco router, which can communicate with a Juniper router, which can communicate with a Dell PC.

That's the importance of having industry standards.

Okay, that was another lesson with a lot of information.

Once again, there will be supplementary materials to help you remember everything 

There, will , of course, be an end-of-video quiz, coming up from the next slide.

There will also be premade flash cards to help you memorize what you need to remember, check the link the description.

Finally, for this video I will again include a Packet Tracer practice lab, which will use an interesting feature of packet tracer called 'simulation mode' to analyze network traffic.

Now let's go to the quiz

---------------------------------------------

### Lab 03 - OSI Model

In this lab we will examine some network traffic using packet tracer's simulation mode feature

But first, let's take a look at the network diagram

There are two routers, R1 and R2, two switches, SW1 and SW2, and one server and one PC

The G0/0,G0/1,G0/2 and F0/1 labels indicate the network interfaces used to connect the devices

G means gigabit ethernet, so these interfaces operate at a speed of one gigabit per second 

You might also see it written as Gi, or Gig, but I usually just use G.F means fastethernet, so these interfaces operate at 100 megabits per second. 

You might also see it written as Fa, instead of just F. Now these two series of numbers here, 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24, are network addresses.

Routers are used to connect different networks.

There are two networks displayed here in this diagram, the one on the left here includes SRV1, PC1, SW1,SW2 and R1's G0/0 interface

They are all in a single network, or subnet, a term you will learn about soon.

So, that's the 192.168.1.0/24 network, and the .100 for SRV1 means that its IP address is 192.168.1.100 and the .1 by R1 means that its address is 192.168.1.1

Wait for the lesson about IP addresses coming up soon for more information on this topic

The other network is 10.0.0.0/24, consisting of R1's G0/1 interface, and R2's G0/0

interface.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AVqEFgI.png)

Notice the .1 and .2, so R1 is 10.0.0.1 and R2 is 10.0.0.2

Hopefully that helps you understand a little bit about how to read a network diagram

Don't worry if you have no idea how IP addresses work, or what that /24 next to the network addresses means, that will all be explained in a video coming soon.

So let's get started on today's main topic

I'm going to use packet tracer's simulation mode, which you can activate here, in the bottom right.

Now, I can click through here, and you can see various network traffic being sent around.

Let's take a look at some.

At Device SW2 means that SW2 is the one sending out the data, it says, STP 

STP is spanning-tree protocol, a layer 2 protocol you'll learn a lot about in this course. Let's click on it, and notice that the 7 layers of the OSI model, and STP has information in the bottom two

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iNsUMPY.png)

Let's look at the Layer 2 header

Notice it says Layer 2: IEEE 802.3 header.

You might remember that IEEE 802.3 is the standard number for Ethernet, so this is an Ethernet Layer 2 header.

Let's look at some of the information here. 

Down here it shows some information about the process, and notice here at number 2: The device encapsulates the PDU into an Ethernet frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c6sqW8r.png)

There's the encapsulation process I talked about in the lecture video.

Let's take a look at the Layer 1 info

Notice that the information is the two interfaces that it sends the frame out of.

Information like the physical ports, or interfaces, on a device are Layer 1 information, because it is the physical layer.

Now let's look at another bit of network traffic, this time AT device R1, and the type is OSPF

OSPF is a layer 3 protocol, it's used to discover the best paths to different network.

You'll learn a lot about it, too, in this course.

STP only had layer 2 and layer 1 information, but OSPF has layer 3, layer 2, and Layer 1.

Notice in the Layer 3 header, source IP address, and destination IP address.

Remember, IP addresses are layer 3 information.

Next, to look at some traffic that includes information all the way up to Layer 7, I will go on PC1.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yhzHMhF.png)

PC1 is using a protocol called DHCP to automatically receive an IP address 

To generate some DHCP traffic, and DHCP is a layer 7 protocol, I'll get PC1 to release its current IP address, and then renew it

When you click on a PC in packet tracer you'll see this screes.

Click on desktop, then command prompt, to access the PC's command prompt, which functions like a windows command prompt.

Type ipconfig, and you can see the current IP address here ... to release the IP address, type ipconfig /release.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FTsRssQ.png)

And now you can see already a DHCP message on PC1

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VnEYeQX.png)

I'll type the next command to, to renew the IP address 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OqHuubs.png)

Now let's check one of these DHCP messages.

Notice information all the way up to Layer 7, except layers 5 and 6.

That's because in the TCP/IP model, which is the model actually in use, layers 5,6 and 7 are all combined into a single layer called the application layer, so you're not going to see any layer 5 or 6 information, but you can consider it to be part of the layer 7 information.

Then there is layer 4 information, if you click on it, it says the device encapsulates the PDU into a UDP segment, remember the Layer 4 PDU is called a segment.

Layer 3, Layer 2, and Layer 1 information is present as well.

Now, if I just press the play button in the middle, it will slowly play through all of the different messages being sent through the network.

That's all for this lab, I just wanted to show you the OSI and TCP/IP models at work on a network.

Your understanding of the functions of these layers might still be a little unclear, but trust me, you'll understand things better as we start to actually learn about these diffrent protocols that operate at each layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 4. Intro to the CLI

In this fourth lesson, we will finally get started actually configuring some Cisco devices.

This lesson is about the Cisco IOS CLI

Cisco IOS is the operating system used on Cisco devices, like Windows on a PC, or macOS on an imac.

Keep in mind, Cisco's IOS is not related to Apple's iOS for iPhones.

Now, what is a CLI ?

CLI stands for command-line interface 

It's the interface you use to configure Cisco devices, like routers, switches, and firewalls.

Here's an image of the Cisco IOS CLI

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vWdIlNK.png)

The color scheme can be changed, this is just the default color scheme with the software

I used when taking this screenshot.

Now, there is also something called a GUI, which means graphical user interface.

Here's an example of a Cisco GUI, from Cisco's ASDM which can be used to configure Cisco's Firewalls.

However, we won't cover GUIs in this course, and most network engineers prefer to use the CLI over a GUI.

Now, how exactly do you connect to a Cisco device to configure it with the CLI ?

There are a couple methods, but I'm going to talk about connecting via the console port.

Connecting to a device via the console port typically involves bringing your laptop to the device and connecing to the console port of the device. There are also methods to connect to a device remotely, but we'll cover that later

In any case, when you first configure a device, you have to connect to the console port

This is an image of a Cisco catalyst switch, and notice the two console ports.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vgavMl6.png)

one of them is an RJ45 port, just like the switch's network ports

The other is a USB mini-b-connector.

You can connect to either of these, but let's say we're going to connect to the RJ45 port.

You're going to need the proper cable.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JqTwAnl.png)

This is the kind of cable you will use

Notice one end has an RJ45 connector, just like the Ethernet UTP cables we looked at.

The other end is a D89 connector.

However, most laptops these days no longer have a serial port to plug the cable into

So you'll probably need an adapter, like this, to connect to a USB port on your laptop.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lpMpmo1.png)

The actual name of the cable on the left is 'rollover cable'

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HbJ5a96.png)

The name is similar to crossover cable, but it's different than an Ethernet UTP

Like is an Ethernet UTP cables, there are 8 pins on each end that are used.

However, they connect like this: pin 1 to pin 8, pin 2 to pin 7, pin 3 to pin 6, pin 4 to pin 5, pin 5 to pin 4, pin 6 to pin 3,pin 7 to pin 2, and pin 8 to pin 1.

So, once you've connected your computer to the device, how do actually access the CLI ?

Well, you need to use a terminal emulator, this one here, PuTTy, is a popular choice. 

You can get it at putty.org.select serial, here, and then click open and you should be connected to the CLI

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/84QTOIg.png)

You should be able to connect with the default settings, but click serial down here, and you can view and edit the default settings for the serial connection. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TKsTNyN.png)

Note that these settings match the defaults on Cisco devices, so you'll probably never have to change them, but it's good to be aware of them, and try to remember them for the test.

The speed, also known as baud ratem is 9600 bits per second.

There are 8 data bits and 1 stop bit

Understanding data bits and stop bit is outside of the scope of the CCNA, but basically it means that for each 8 bits of data one stop bit is sent, to mark the end of the 8 bits. Parity is set to none.

Parity is used to detect errors.

And finally, flow control is set to none.

Flow control is exactly what it sounds like, controlling the flow of data from transmitter to receiver, but again you don't have to worry about the details for the exam.

Just remember Cisco's defaults

Speed of 9600 bits per second, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control.

Once you connect to the device, you will be greeted with a screen like this.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vRy9LmB.png)

Since this is the first time booting up the devices, I am asked if I would like to enter the initial configuration dialog, and I answer no. Then I pressed the enter key to get started, and I'm now free to type commands into the CLI.

When you first enter the CLI, you will by default be in what's called 'user EXEC mode'

User EXEC mode is indicated by the 'greater than sign' next to the host name of the device. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/17vyWWh.png)

Note that the dedault host name for this device is 'Router'

The text displayed here always indicates the hostname of the device

All devices have a hostname, and for a Cisco router the default name is Router.

User EXEC mode is very limited.

Users can look at some things, but can't make any changes to the configuration.

Usually you don't do anything in this mode 

You also might hear it called just 'user mode'

So, let's move to a mode with a little more power to make changes to the device

If you enter the 'enable' command in user EXEC mode, you will be placed in privileged exec mode

In privileged exec mode, a pound sign, or hashtag, whatever you want to call, it displayed

Privileged EXEC mode provides complete access to view the device's configuration, restart the device, etc

This is not the mode in which you actually change the configuration, however you can change the time on the device, and also save the current configuration file, among many other things.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TQOuO3y.png)

This is a comparison of the command available in user EXEC mode, on the left, and privileged EXEC mode, on the right.

Also, I'm taking these screenshots from Cisco Packet Tracer software.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tyJ1s2n.png)

Packet Tracer is a network simulator.

It is a fantastic resource for the CCNA, but it is limited beyond the CCNA.

There are many things which Packet Tracer doesn't support, so if I were to show these commands on a real device, you would probably see even more commands available here.

I want to repeat, however, that Packet Tracer is an excellent resource for the CCNA and you don't really need to use anything else for your CCNA.

One more thing, notice the command I used to view the available commands.

You can use a question mark to view the commands that are available to you.

Now I want to show you a convenient feature of the CLI

That is the tab key

In the sample output here, notice the first line says en, the second says enable, and then I entered privileged exec mode.

Well, if you press tab, the CLI will automatically complete the word for you, and display the complete word on a new line

However, another convenient thing is that you don't even need to complete the command 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Mozs8vg.png)

Here i just typed 'en', and hit enter, and I was brought to privileged EXEC mode. This can really save you a lot of typing when you're entering many commands.

There are limits to this, however Although 'en' was enough for the router to understand that I meant to use the command 'enable', that's because it's the only command that begins with EN that can be entered in user EXEC mode. If i type just 'e', however, we are told that it is an ambiguous command. That's because there's more than one command that begins with e.

How can we view the commands that begin with e ?

Well, remember the question mark from before ?

If i type e, followed by a question mark, it displays the possible commands that begin with e.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Q4N1w1Y.png)

There are two, enable and exit, so if I type just 'e' and hit enter, the router doesn't know which command I want to use

So, the shortest form of the enable command is 'en'

And, the shortest form of the exit command is 'ex'

Now let's actually make some changes to the router's configuration

To do so, we enter 'global configuration mode'

The command to enter configuration mode is configure terminal

When in global configuration mode, config is inserted after the hostname

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y9UG7kd.png)

Once again, you don't have to type the whole word

Notice I type con, followed by the question mark , and there are two option, configure and connect .

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/36lQJuO.png)

So, the shortest possible command for configure is conf, c-o-n-f

However, terminal is the only option beginning with T, so all I need to type CONF T to enter global configuration mode.

From now on, in all of my lab demonstrations and such, I will probably be typing conf t instead of configure terminal

Try to remember that the full command is configure terminal, but also feel free to use the shortcuts.

Now, we don't want just anyone to be able to make changes to the network configuration, or even able to just look at the configuration, because that could be a security risk.

We can protect privileged exec mode with a password, so that if a user enters the 'enable' command from user EXEC mode, they are asked for the password 

That is done with the command 'enable password' in global configuration mode  

First, i want to clarify the use of the question mark 

Notice that I used the question mark with no space after password

here is the output 

If you use the question mark with no space, it shows you all possible completions of that word

I already typed the full word password, so it just displays the word again, and there are no other words that begin with p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d

Next I used the question mark again, this this time with a space after password 

Notice the difference in the output

This time it shows all possible options we could enter next in the command 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/D4DQSRc.png)

In this case, I used the middle one

Notice that LINE is in all capital letters

That means that you don't actually type LINE, you type a line which will become the password

I typed CCNA in all capitals as the password 

Note that Password ARE case-sensitive, so CCNA in capital letters and ccna in lower-case letters different passwords

Once again I typed the question mark to check if there are any further options.

This cr means that there are no further options, the only option is to press enter to enter the command 

I pressed enter, and now the password is set.

Let's test it

So, let's test out our password

I type exit to return to privileged EXEC mode. 

From privileged exec mode, if I type exit again I am logged out of the device and see the starting screen again.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8XKrGbK.png)

If I press enter here

I am brought back to user exec mode

If I enter the enable command, I am asked for a password. No password displays here, but i am brought to priveleged exec mode

That's because the password does not display as you type it, for security purposes.

Also, note that if you enter the wrong password 3 times, you will denied access for having bad screts 

I think everyone has bad secrets of some kind, but in this case it means an incorrect password 

Let's review what we've done so far 

In my experience it was difficult to get used to operating in the CLI when I first started learning, so we'll take it slow and review along the way.

Also, make sure to check out the next video after you finish this, which will have you doing these same tasks in packet tracer.

Hands-on practice is absolutely essential to get comfortable with the CLI

So, I use the enable command to enter privileged exec mode, From privileged exec mode, I use configure terminal to enter global configuration mode.

In global configuration mode, I use the command enable password CCNA to protect privileged exec mode with a password

Remember, this password is case-sensitive. Then I type exit to return privileged exec mode and exit again to return user exec mode. I type enable again then I enter the password, which isn't displayed as I type it, and I am brought back into privileged 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4d0krvN.png)

We confirmed the function of the password, but let's take a look at the configuraion file itself to check it

First I want to explain the two configuration files kept on the device. As I said, there are two separate configuration files kept on the device at once 

One is the running-config. This is the current, active configuration file on the device. As you enter commands in the CLI, you edit the active configuration 

The startup-config is the configuration file that will loaded upon restart of the device 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/i3oLthF.png)

If you reload the device, or shut it down and then turn it on later, the startup-config will be loaded.

So let's take a look at the configuration files 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3IdPtfh.png)

Use the 'show running-config' command in global configuration mode to view the running configuration file. 

There is lots of data in the file by default so I only included the output up to the command we entered.

Here's the command, enable password CCNA, in the running-config 

How about the startup-config ?

You can view it with the show startup-config command, however as you can see, at this point it just displays the message 'startup-config' is not present.

This is because we haven't saved the running configuration yet, so every time we restart the router it will load a default configuration, not the startup-configuration. 

Let's save the configuration file 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BKAGvqr.png)

There are actually three ways you can save the running-configuration, to make it the startup-configuration 

All three of these commands are executed from privileged exec mode.

The first is 'write'

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XzAc2Wi.png)

It says building configuration, and then an OK message to indicate that the configuration was saved.

The second method is write memory, it performs the same function.

The third command is copy running-config startup-config

This tells the router to copy the running-config file to the startup-config file, again performing the same function as the previous two commands.

Now if use the show startup-config command again, it displays the same configuration as the show running-config command.

Once again, however, this is only the beginning of the output, there is more below.

We'll check it out in the packet tracer lab video coming up text.

Now, you can see the enable password right here, in plain text.

This is a security risk, because anyone who simply takes a glance at this password knows how to get into privileged exec mode, and then global configuration mode to make changes to the device.

Let's level up the security a bit.

You can do so with the 'service password-encryption' command in global configuration mode.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k1S0kEG.png)

Notice I used the short version of configure terminal, conf t, to enter global configuration mode. Remember that all of these commands have shortcuts. I'll usually use the full command for these instructional videos, but in the labs when I enter the commands live you'll see me using shortcuts a lot.

Any way, the service password-encryption command will encrypt all passwords in a jumble of numbers and letters, so that they cannot be easily read.

If I enter the show running-config command again, notice that the password 'CCNA' has become 08026F6028

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CrWioFs.png)

The password itself hasn't changed, it is still CCNA, only the way it is displayed in the configuration has changed.

Also, you may notice that a 7 has appeared before the password. This number '7' indicates the type of encryption used to encrypt the password. The number 7 means it is using Cisco's proprietary encryption algorithm, from the service password-encryption command. 

Later in this video, you will see another number in that place .

While using the 'service password-encryption' command is more secure than not using it, it's still not very secure.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LCjgVxT.png)

In this screenshot I simply searched for a cisco type 7 password cracker on google [Link](https://www.ifm.net.nz/cookbooks/passwordcracker.html), found this website, and was able to crack the password in a few seconds.

The good news, though, is that there is a more secure enable password that can be used on Cisco devices, with a tougher type of encryption. The more secure method is to use the enable secret command, instead of the enable password command

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MtGT8uj.png)

This time I used a password of Cisco, with an upper-case C. Once again, this is case-sentitive.

Then I view the running configuration once more.

However, since I was still in global configuration mode, I typed 'do' in the front of the command.

This is a convenient trick that allows you to execute privileged exec mode commands like show running-config or show startup-config, in other configuration levels.

Also notice I used shortcuts, sh instead if show and run instead of running-config.

Now you can see the enable secret in the running-configuration.

~[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MC2JtIs.png)

Notice the number 5 before the encrypted password .

Number 5 indicates MD5 type encryption, which is much more secure than what we got with the service password-encryption command.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CUE7lKt.png)

It can still be cracked, no password is invicible, but its much better.

Also notice that the enable password command remains, it isn't replaced.

However, if both the enable secret and enable password commands are configured, the enable password will be ignored, only the enable secret will be valid.

One final note, the 'service password-encryption' command has NO effect on the enable secret command.

The enable secret is always encrypted, wheather or not you entered the service password-encryption command.

So, really you should always use the enable secret, instead of the enable password, as it is more secure.

Now I want to show you one more thing in the CLI before we move on to the quiz for today's video. 

That is , how you cancel, or delete, a command that you entered.

That is done by typing 'no' in front of the command.

For example, if I type 'no' in front of the service password encryption command, future passwords will no longer be encrypted.

However, as you can see here, passwords which are already encrypted will NOT be decrypted by disabling service password-encryption.

If I enter a new password, however, it will be in clear text, NOT encrypted.

So, let me summarize the service-password encryption command.

If you enable service password-encryption current passwords will be encrypted, future passwords will also be encrypted. 

Once again, however, the enable secret will not be affected, it is always ecrypted.

If you disable service password-encryption current passwords will not be decrypted, they will remain encrypted. Future passwords will not be encrypted, they will remain in clear-text.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/P0xwCXh.png)

The enable secret will not be effected, once again it is always encrypted.

Let's review all of the commands and such we learned in this lesson.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UxkCEX4.png)

 First, the different modes of the Cisco CLI we looked at today.

 Router> ----- = user EXEC mode.

 Router# ----- = privileged EXEC mode

 Router(config)# = global configuration mode

 Finally is global configuration mode, indicated by config in brackets, plus the hashtag.

 ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Xnap3Kh.png)

 Now let's review some commands.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Device Security - Day 4 Lab

In this lab, we'll finally get hands on in the Cisco IOS CLI, the command line interface.

If you're already watched the Day 4 lecture video, you should be able to complete these tasks on your own.

Even if you can, I recommand watching this video after to check and get any additional explanations.

So, we've got a small network here with a few PCs, and switch, and a router.

Our tasks involve some basic configurations on the router and switch.

For this video, I will only configure the router.

However, I recommend that you go through the steps on both devices.

Repetition is essential to get used to all the commands you need to know, so remember to configure both devices.

Step 1 is to set the approriate host name for each device, R1 and SW1.

We didn't cover the command in the main video, but to do so you use the 'hostname' command in global configuration mode.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZV0gkNR.png)

Now, in the lecture video, I explained about how to connect to the console port of a device.

In packer tracer, you can actually do that, connect a PC to the console port of the device and then use the PC to do the configurations. However, simply clicking on the device itself is much more convenient, so that's what we'll be doing for these labs. Just keep in mind that in real life, you can't configure the device directly on the device itself, you have to connect to it with a computer. The current hostname for each device is displayed here.

As you can see, by default the hostname is router. To change the hostname, we must enter 'Global configuration' mode.

However to get there, we must first enter 'Privileged exec' mode.

This is achieved by using the 'enable' command. 

To demonstrate a shortcut, I will use the 'exit' command to return to the previous exec mode.

Notice that you can enter privileged exec mode by simply typing 'en' and then use tab to auto-complete it to 'enable', but this isn't necessary.

'en' alone is fine.

'e', however, is too short, and we are told this is an ambiguous command. This is because there are other potential commands that begin with 'e', which we can see by tying 'e' and then a question mark.

As you can see, there are two potential commands; enable and exit.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oPzyCCv.png)

So, if you just enter 'e', the router doesn't know which command you mean.

However, 'enable' is the only command beginning with 'en', so 'en' is all the router needs to know which command you mean.

Now that we are in privileged exec mode, we can use the 'configure terminal' command to get to 'global configuration' mode.

If you want to use shortcuts again as we did with enable and 'en', the shortest version of the 'configure terminal' command is 'conf t'.

From here we can set the hostname of the router.

This is done with the hostname command.

I will enter 'hostname' R1

Step 2 is to set the uncrypted enable password on each router to CCNA

The 'enable password' is used to privileged exec mode, which is also called enable mode.

Previously we had no password set, so we were able to hear privileged exec mode without any password.

Now we are going to protect privileged exec mode so that only administrators can access it.

The command is simple, and it done in 'global configuration' mode, which we are already in.

Type 'enable password CCNA'.

Now let's test it out, which is step 3

From here  I will use exit command twice, once to bring me back to privileged exec mode.

and then once again to bring me back to user exec mode.

Now I will use the enable command again, however this time I am asked for a password.

The character do not appear as I type, however if I type the password 'CCNA' correctly and press enter I am brought to privileged exec mode.

Now let's see what happens if I fail to enter the correct password.

I enter the wrong password once, twice, and then three times before being rejected for having 'bad secret'.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ubHf6OE.png)

Now I will try again with the correct password, and I'm in

Step 3 is now complete.

Step 4 is simply to view the password in the running configuration.

The running configuration is the current active configuration of the router, whether or not you have actually saved it.

If you turn off the router without saving the running configuration you will lose any changes.

If you want to keep your changes you have to save them to the startup configuration.

To view the running configurationm, use the show running-config command from privileged exec mode, which we are already in.

You can abbreviate it too, for example sh run.

As you can see it is not encrypted, it is written in clear text right.

Let's solve that in step 5.

So step 4 is now complete.

Step 5 is to enable password encryption on the device.

We can protects passwords by encrypting them to render them unreadable.

This is done from global configuration mode with the command 'service password-encryption'

Okay, that's all for step 5

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/g8ruYCq.png)

Step 6 is to once again view the running config

I will use the same command as before, and now lets check the password.

However the command doesn't work

That is because we are currently in global configuration mode, and show running-config must be entered from privileged exec mode.

Now, I could type exit to drop back to privileged exec mode and then enter the command.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MHQFJNX.png)

But there is no more way, which I demonstrated in the lecture video.

If I type 'do' in front of the command, I can enter it from global configuration mode.

'do sh run (do show running-config)'. There we go.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MHQFJNX.png)

You can see here 'enable password', followed by a 7 and then a string of other numbers.

The password has successfully been encrypted.

Although we didn't type this 7 when we entered the command, it refers to the type of encryption used.

There are other types as well.

The string of numbers that follow are the password 'CCNA', encrypted to be unreadable so that anyone looking over out shouder can't read the password.

Keep in mind that the encryption used in the 'service password-encryption' isn't vety secure and can be cracked, but this at least renders the password safe from someone simply glancing over your shoulder.

Step 6 is now complete.

Step 7 is to configure a more secure, encrypted enable password of 'Cisco'.

That can be DONE with the 'enable secret' command.

The enable secret uses MD5 encryption, which is more secure that what you get with the service password-encryption command.

Since we're already in global configuration mode, let's enter the command.

Enable secret Cisco.

Now let's go on Step 8, which is to exit back to user EXEC mode and try to login.

Okay, now let's try to get back to privileged EXEC mode.

Let's try our original password of 'CCNA' .. it doesn't work anymore

How about our newly configired enable secret ?

As you can see, if both an enable secret and enable password are configured, only the enable secret can be used.

The enable password becomes invalid

Step 9 is to once again view the passwords in the running configuration

Show running - config

There they are

Once again, the enable password with service password-encryption uses type 7 encryption, indicated by this 7 here.

The enable secret uses type 5 encryption, which is MD5 encryption.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mZ7devz.png)

Step 10 is to save the running configuration to the startup configuration.

There are threes way to do this

One is write ... another is write memory ... and the third is copy running-config startup-config.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/r6ZOsFA.png)

There's the config, and you can see the passwords we configured here.

If I scroll through you can see lots of other default settings for the device here.

Step 10 is now complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 1)

This is the fifth lesson, and now we're going to get more into the details of how data travels through a network.

This time we'll focus on Ethernet LAN switching, So if we look simple network consisting of a few PCs, a switch, and a router, connected to the Internet, today we'll be looking at how data moves around between the switches and the end hosts connected to them, and to their router.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ueX3iWL.png)

How data is sent from the router to other networks will be a topic for another video, but let's start small.

First let's review

This is slide from Day 3's video of describing the physical layer of OSI model, The physical layer defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices.

For example voltage levels, maximum transmission distances (like Ethernet UTP cables' 100 meter limit), physical connectors, cable specifications, etc.

Digitals bits are converted into electrical (for wired connections) or radio(for wireless connections) signals.

All of the information in Day 2's video (cables,pin layouts) is related to the Physical Layer.

So, we've covered a good amount about the physical layer, learning about cropper UTP cables, fiber-optic cables, RJ45 connectes, etc.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HbIfzCm.png)

Let's go review this silde about Layer 2, the Data Link layer, from Day 3's video.

Layer 2 provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer, for example PC to switch, or switch to router, or router to router, etc,...It defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (for example, copper UTP cables) 

It detects and possibly corrects Physical Layer errors.

It uses layer 2 addressing, which is separate from Layer 3 addressing.

Remember IP, IP address are Layer 3 addresses, not Layer 2

Switches operate at Layer 2.

So, in this video we'll be talking about Ethernet LAN switching, and Ethernet involves Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model.

Since we've already covered the Layer 1 Ethernet standards like UTP cables, this video will be about Layer. Then, as we continue with this series, we'll move up the layers of the OSI model, until you get a complete image of how data is sent and received over networks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tXkMSp9.png)

Now, let's talk about what a LAN, or Local Area Network is.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bAxZhX5.png)

There are different ways of defining a LAN, and your understanding of a LAN will become more complete as you learn more and more about networking.

But basically, it's a network contained within a relatively small area, like an office floor, or your home network.

Routers are used to connect separate LANs.

Looking at this diagram, how many LANs do you think there are ?

Well, by the definition I'm using, this green network, consisting of three PCs, one switch, and the router interface they are connect to, is one LAN. This red network is also one LAN. Although there are two switches, it is all one LAN.

Swithces do not separate LANs, but adding more switches can be used to expand an exsiting LAN.

So these red devices are part of one large LAN.

Now, what do you think about the blue devices ?

There's the same devices as in the red network, but instead of the switches being connected to each other, they are connected to different router interfaces.

So, that means they are two separate LANs. One for this switch, it's end hosts and their router interface, and one for this switch, it's end hosts, and the router interface they connect to.

So, in this lesson we'll look at at how traffic is sent and received within LANs like these, for example this PC in LAN 2 to another PC in LAN. But, we'll leave the topic of sending data between LANs for a later video.

Here's one more bit of review.

This shows the encapsulation process as data is prepared to be sent over a network.

At the top, the data prepared by the upper layers of the OSI model is simply called data.

A layer 4 header is added, and this combination of data and layer 4 header is called a segment.

A layer 3 header is added to the segment, and it is now called a packet.

Finally, a Layer 2 header and trailer are added to the packet, and it becomes a frame

Once again, these different stages of preparing data to be forwarded are called 'protocol data units' or PDUs. For example, the Layer 2 PDU is a frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cs2NHQk.png)

Today we're going to focus on how switches receive and forward frames, specifically Ethernet frames. Since it's the layer 2 protocol used in virtually every LAN in existence today.

Let's take a look at the actual contents of this Ethernet header and trailer.

So, here's an Enthernet frame, encapsulating the packet with a header and trailer.

Note that I put the header on the left and the trailer on the right, opposite of previous slide

Let's look at the header.

Don't worry, I'll cover these in more detail, but here's a quick rundown

There are five fields in the header. First, the preamble and SFD, which means start frame delimeter, these are used for synchronization and to allow the receiving device to be prepared to receive the rest of the data in the frame. 

Next is the destination,the Layer 2 address to which the frame is being sent , next is the source, the Layer 2 address of the device which sent the frame. The final field in the Ethernet header is the type.

It indicates the Layer 3 protocol used in the encapsulated Packet, which is almost always Internet Protocol, or IP, or IP version 6.

However, sometimes this is a length field, indicating the length of of the encapsualted data, depending on the version of Ethernet.

Now, the Ethernet trailer has only one field . That's is FCS, which stands for frame check sequence. It's used by the receiving device to detect any errors that might occurred in transmission.

Okay, now let's take a look at these fields in more detail, starting with the preamble and start frame delimeter

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/59eqivQ.png)

Here are the first two fields, the Preamble and SFD, which I like to think of as a set. Let's look at the preamble first. It's 7 bytes long. How many bits is that ? 

If you remember, there are 8 bits in 1 bute, so , 7 times 8 is equal to 56 bits

It's a series of alternating 1s and 0s. Like this 10101010 * 7 , which is one bytem seven times

The purpose of this is that it allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks, to make sure they're ready to receive the rest of the frame and the data inside. 

Okay, that's the preamble, now the SFD.

SFD stands for 'start frame delimeter' It's length 1 byte, or 8 bits.

It's bit pattern is 10101011, similar to each byte of the preamble but the last bit is a 1, not a 0. 

It indicates the end of preamble and the begining of the rest of the frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/G9kg41R.png)

Now let's look at the next two fields, the destination and source fields.

They indicate the devices sending and receiving the frame, like when you send an email both the destination and source email address are included in the email, or when you send a letter in the mail, although that's getting less and less common these days.

The addresses used in Ethernet are the destination and source 'MAC addresses'

MAC stands for media access control.

The MAC address is a 6-byte, or 48 bit, address of the physical device.

This is separate from a logical address like an IP address, the MAC address is actually assigned to the device when it is made.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4BwJe63.png)

I'll talk more about MAC addresses in a few slides, but let's move on to the remaining fields of the Ethernet frame.

The last field of the Ethernet header is the Type or Length field.

It is 2-bytes, or 16-bits, in length.

It can be used to represent either the type of the encapsulated packet, or the length of the encapsulated packet.

What do I mean by that ?

Well, if the value in the field is 1500 or less, that means it is indicating of the LENGTH of the encapsulated packet in bytes.

For example, if the value in this field is 1400, it means that the encapsualted packet is 1400 bytes in length. However, a value of 1536 or greater in this field indicates the TYPE of the encapsulated packet, which is usually internet protocol version 4 or version 6, and then the length is determined via other methods.

For example, a value of 0x0800, which is written in hexadecimal, and is equal to 2048 in decimal

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/p1WXy85.png)

The 0x in front of 0800 is used to indicate hexadecimal, by the way. I'll talk more about hexadecimal in a few slides when I talk in detail about MAC addresses.

2048 is greater than 1536, of course, and its used to identify that the encapsulated packet is an IPv4 packet.

0x86DD, which is equal to 34525 in decimal, is used to indicate that the encapsulated packet is an IPv6

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4Y8gT8q.png)

Okay, so those are all of the fields in an Ethernet header.

Try to remember the lengths of each field 

Now let's take a brief look at the only field of the Ethernet trailer, the FCD, or frame check sequence 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7W01GdC.png)

The only field of the Ethernet trailer is the FCS, which as I mentioned stands for frame check sequece.

'Frame Check Sequence'.

It is 4 bytes ,or 32-bits in length.

It's purpose is to detect corrupted data by running a 'CRC' algorithm over the received data

CRC means cyclic redundancy check.

Cyclic refers to something called 'cyclic codes', 'redundancy' refers to the fact that these 4 bytes at the end of the message enlarge the message without adding any new information, so they are redundant and check refers to the fact that is CHECKS, or verifies, the data for errors. 

Don't worry about the details of CRC too much, just be aware of the term, and remember that the Ethernet frame's Frame Check Sequence is a Cyclic Redundancy Check.

If you remember that, you should be good for the CCNA.

Feel free to read around on Wikipedia if you're curious to learn more about Cyclic Redundancy Checks.

Okay, now we know all of the fields of an Ethernet frame, both the header and the trailer.

Try to recall the length of each field again.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sXydspI.png)

This brings the total size, including header and trailer, to 26 bytes.

=26 bytes (header + trailer)

So, there's an overview of each field of an Ethernet frame.

However, the fields I really want to focus on in this video are the source and destination MAC address fields.

I mentioned a little bit about MAC addresses, but let's dig a little deeper

So let's spend a few slides looking into MAC addresses.

As I mentioned before, a MAC address is a 6-byte, or 48-bit,physical address assigned to the device when it is made.

This is different than an IP address, which you assign in the CLI when you config the device.

You might also hear the term 'burned in address', or BIA, to refer to a MAC address.

This is because the address in 'burned-in' to the device as it is made.

The MAC address is globally unique, no two devices in the world should have the same MAC address.

Although, there are MAC addresses known as 'locally-unique' MAC address, which don't have to be globally throughtout the world, however in almost all cases MAC addresses are globally unique.

The first 3 bytes of the MAC address are the OUI, which stands for organizationally unique identifier, and it's assigned to the company making the device.

So cisco, for example, will have various OUIs which only Cisco can use, and other makers will have their own OUIs which only they can use.

The last 3 bytes, the second half of the address , are unique to the device itself. MAC addresses are written as a series of 12 hexadecimal characters.

For those of you who aren't sure what hexadecimal is, let's check it out a little bit.

Before explaining hexadecimal, I want to make sure we all understand how the decimal system works.

I don't mean to insult anyone's intelligence, I'm sure you all know how to count, but let's just review the system so we can compare it to hexadecimal.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7GAh5Qv.png)

So, that's how the decimal system works.

Let's look at hexadecimal.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xVaWN51.png)

We already saw the hexadecimal numbers up to F, which is equal to decimal 15.

Notice how the numbers are written after F.

Let's move on

So here's a simple network, just three PCs connected to a switch.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zItrqnR.png)

Notice the interface names for the swith, F0/1,F0/2 and F0/3. F means fastethernet ,so these are 100 megabit per second interfaces. I've also written the MAC address for each PC. you're probably not going to see any MAC addresses like these, I've just simplified them for this demonstration.

Notice each MAC address is a series of 12 hexadecimal digits, separated by periods.

You may also see periods after every other digit, so for example PC1's MAC address would be AAAA.AA00.0001. But I tend to write them after every fourth character The OUI, or organizationally unique identifier, which is the first half of the MAC address, is AAAAAA for each device, so we know that these PCs are all from the same maker.

The second half of the MAC address of each device, however, is different for each PC, as the second half identifiers the device itself. Now, let's say PC1 wants to send some data to PC2. Due to lack of space I've just written an abbreviated form of the destination and source MAC addresses here.

By the way, this kind of frame is called a 'unicast frame', a frame destined for a single target, PC2 in this case. There are other kinds of frames, like broadcast frames, which we'll learn as we go along.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4w4ZokJ.png)

But for now, remember this term, unicast 

PC1 sends the frame through it's network interface card, which is connected to SW1, and SW1 receives the frame. After SW1 receives the frame, it looks at the source MAC address field of the frame and then uses that information to LEARN where PC1 is. As you can see here, it adds the MAC address AAAA.AA00.0001 to it's MAC Address table and it associates that MAC address with its F0/1 interface.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hVeGHcf.png)

This is known as a 'dynamically learned' MAC address, or just 'dynamic MAC address', because it wasn't manually configured on the switch, the switch learned it self. 

Every switch will keep a MAC address table like this, and they fill the MAC address table dynamically by looking at the source MAC address of frames it receives.

Since SW1 received a fram from source source MAC Address AAAA.AA00.0001 on it's F0/1 interfaces.

It knowns that I can reach that MAC addresses on that interfaces, and adds it to the MAc address table.

This is a very important concept, so I'll probably repeat it multiples times.

This is how switches dynamically learn where each device on the network is, by looking at the source MAC address of the frame. Now, there is one problem

The destination of the frame is AAAA.AA0000.0002, but SW1 doesn't know where that is.

This, by the way is called an 'unknown unicast' frame, a frame for which the switch doesn't have any entry in its MAC address table.

Because the switch doesn't know how to reach the destination, it has only one option.

That is to FLOOD the frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/apJPkVd.png)

Flood means to forward the frame out of ALL of its interfaces, except the one it received the packet on.

So, that would like this.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xy1Ulcc.png)

SW1 copies the frame and sends it out its F0/2 and F0/3 interfaces.

It doesn't send it out of its F0/1 interfaces, because that's the interface it received the frame on

So, what happens next ?

Well, PC3 ignores the packet, because the destination MAC address doesn't match its own MAC address, it simply drops the packet.

PC2, however, receives the packet and then processes it normally , up the OSI stack.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ddVY92T.png)

However, unless PC2 send a reply of some sort, it stops there.

SW1 never receives a packer from PC2, so it can't learn PC2's MAC address and use it to populate the MAC address table.

So, let's say PC1 sends another frame to PC2. Once again, it is received by SW1 and it already knows PC1's MAC address, so it doesn't have to add it to the MAC address table again.

However, it still doesn't know where PC2 is, so it once again floods the frame.

PC3 drops the frame, and PC2 receives it and processes it normally.

Now, let's say PC2 then wants to send some data to PC1, maybe a reply to what PC1 sent to PC2.

Notice the destination and source addresses of the frame are reversed

PC2 sends the frame out of its network interface, and SW1 receives it 

SW1 looks at the source MAC address of the frame, and the add its to its MAC address table, associating it with the F0/2 interface.

This time, however, it doesn't flood the frame. This is knowns as a known unicast frame, because the destination is already in its MAC address table. Whereas UNKNOWN unicast frames are flooded, known unicast frames are simply forwarded to the destination, like this.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y4pkmuL.png)

and PC1 then processes the frame up the OSI stack, through the de-encapsulation process which we learned about in day 3's video.

One more point about these dynamic MAC address.

On Cisco switches, these MAC addresses are removed from the MAC address table after 5 minutes of inactivity.

So, if PC1 didn't send any traffic for over 5 minutes, SW1 would remove the MAC address to clean out the MAC address table. 

Of course, if PC1 sent traffic again, SW1 would dynamically learn its MAC address again.

Let's look at another example, this time with two switches.

Notice the MAC address table of each switch.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GaEPNbf.png)

Currently they are empty, so once again we will see the process of MAC address learning and flooding .

So, PC1 wants to send some information to PC3.

The source MAC address of the packet is AAAA.AA00.0001 and the destination is AAAA.AA00.0003.

So, PC1 sends the frame out of its network interface and it arrives at SW1.

SW1 learns PC1's MAC address from the source address field of the frame, and associates it with the interface on which it was received, F0/1. I'll say once more, I'm only writing a short version of the MAC address due to the lack of space here, really the frame and the MAC address table would include the whole MAC address, of course.

Once again, a MAC address learned in this way is called a 'dynamically learned MAC address, or more often' , a'dynamic' MAC address. Now, SW1 has learned that PC1 can be reached via it's F0/1 interface, but it still doesn't know where PC3 is. Do you remember the name for this kind of frame ? It's called an 'unknown unicast frame'. And what does a switch do with an unknown unicast frame ? It floods it out all of its ports, except the one is was received on. In this case, it will flood the frame out of F0/2 and F0/3 , but not F0/1, because it received the frame on F0/1.

PC2 drops the frame because the destination MAC address doesn't match its own MAC address. Now, what will SW2 do ?

Well, the exact same rules apply.

Just like SW1 did, it uses the source MAC address field of the frame to dynamically learn PC's MAC address and the interface it can use to reach PC1.

Note that, unlike on SW1, PC1 isn't actually directly connected to the interface SW2 enters in its own MAC address table. However, this is the interface which SW2 will use to reach PC1. That's the meaning of the interface in the MAC address table, it doesn't mean the device is directly connected to this interface.

Now, SW2 received a unicast frame, that is a frame destined for a single device, but it doesn't know how to reach that device because its not in its MAC address table.

It doesn't know how to reach that device, because its not in its MAC address table.

One last time, what is this kind of frame called ?

It's an unknown unicast frame .

And what does the switch do with it ?

It floods it out all interfaces, except the one it was received on.

So, which interfaces will it send the frame out of ?

Well, it received the frame on F0/3, so it won't be flooded out of that interface, but it will be sent out of all other interfaces, F0/1 and F0/2 in this case. 

PC4 drops the frame because the destination MAC address doesn't match its own.

PC3, however, receives the frame, as the destination MAC address matches its own MAC address.

Let's say that PC3 is going to send a reply back to PC1.

Notice the destination and source MAC address fields of the frame are reserved.

PC3 sends the frame out of its network interface, and it is received by SW2.

SW2 learn PC3's MAC address, and enters the MAC address and the corresponding interface in its MAC address table.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/O5Iz1ix.png)

Just so we're clear, the switch uses the SOURCE MAC ADDRESS field to fill its MAC address table because, if it receives a frame from that source on the interface, it knows that it can reach that MAC address via that interface.

So, let's continue.

SW2 already has an entry for the destination MAC address, AAAA.AAAA00.0001, in its MAC address table, so there is no need to flood the frame.

Instead, it is forwarded normally out of the corresponding interface in the MAC address table, which is F0/3.

The frame is received by SW1, which adds an entry for PC3's MAC address in its MAC address table, with the interface F0/3, since that's where it received the frame. 

Fianlly, since SW1 already has an entry for the destination MAC address in its own MAC address table, SW1 forwards the frame out of the corresponding interface, and it reaches its destination, PC1.

Okay, so that was a lot of information.

QUIZ.

I was actually planning to cover the Ethernet LAN switching topics in a single video, but I've decided to split it up into two videos.

So, let's move on to the quiz for today's video, here's question 1.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 6 - Ethernet LAN Switching  (Part 2)

Once again, we're talking about sending traffic a LAN, like between these three PCs in this small network here.

The topic of how these PCs could send traffic out beyond the router to other network is for a future lesson, let's start locally first, with LAN switching.

Before I get started, I want to speak a little bit more on Ethernet frames which we talked about in the last video.

The preamble + SFD is usually not considered part of the Ethernet header, although it is sent with every Ethernet frame.

So, the Ethernet header consists of these three field, destination, source and type.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kFxn6gN.png)

Therefore, the size of the Ethernet header + trailer is 18 bytes, if you don't include the preamble + SFD. Now, there is also a minimum size for an Ethernet frame. The minimum size is 64 bytes, including the encapsulated payload, the packet. 64 bytes minus the 18 bytes of the header equal 46 bytes. Therefore, the minimum payload size is 46 bytes. If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding bytes are added, and these bytes are all 0s by the way.

For example, if you send a 34-byte packet, 12 bytes of padding will be added.

Remember that the Preamble and SFD might not be included as part of Ethernet header, depending on how you define it, but they are included with every Ethernet frame.

Also, remember the minimum size of the frame, 64 bytes, and that doesn't include the preamble and SFD, by the way.

That means that the minimum payload is 46 bytes, and padding will be addes if the payload is less than that.

Now let's get started with the main topics for today's video.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gXPrYM3.png)

So, here's the same small network we saw in the previous video. There are a couple change,however 

First, I changed the interfaces from FastEthernet to Gigabit ethernet , hence the G0/0,G0/1, and G0/2 for each switch.

Secondly, look at the MAC addresses in the precious video I used AAAA.AA00.0001, for PC1, or .0002 for PC2,etc.

This time, let's use some more realistic MAC addresses. 

Notice once again that the OUI, the first half of the MAC address that identifies the maker of the device, is the same for each PC, 0C2F.B, so that means that the PCs were all made by the same company.

Of course, the second half of each device's MAC address is unique, since that represents the device itself. 

When I refer to these MAC addresses I'll just use the last 4 diits, to keep things simple.

For example, I'll just say PC1's MAC address is 9D00, or PC2's MAC address is 6200. Now, let's add one more thing to this network topology.

Let's add some IP addresses.

We won't actually talk about the details of IP addresses in this video, but we'll nees IP addresses to explain something else in this video.

So, this number here, 192.168.1.0/24, represents this whole network here

Then .1 represents PC1's IP address.

This is just short version, PC1's real IP address is 192.168.1.1

PC2's IP address is 192.168.1.2, PC3's IP address is 192.168.1.3, and PC4's IP address is 192.168.1.4

Now, in the last video I only really showed you part of the picture of how these PCs can communicate with this network.

When a device sends some data to another device, it doesn't just include a source and destination MAC address. Encapsulated within that frame is an Internet Protocol, known as IP , packet and that IP packet include a source and destination IP address. For example, if PC1 wants to send data to PC3, the source IP will be 192.168.1.1 and the destination IP will be 192.168.1.3. The source MAC will be 0C2F.B011.9D00, however PC1 doesn't actually know PC3's MAC address. When you send data to another computer, you enter the IP address, not the MAC address. So, the user entered the IP address 192.168.1.3 as the destination, but PC1 has to discover PC3's MAC address by itself. Remember, these switches are Layer 2 devices, they don't operate at Layer 3, so they need to use MAC addresses, not IP addresses. So, PC1 wants to send this Ethernet frame to PC3, but first it has to learn PC3's MAC address. To do so, it uses something called ARP, the address resolution protocol. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xtP3c54.png)

Let's take a look at ARP

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.

It is used to discover the Layer 2 address, meaning the MAC address, of a known layer 3 address, meaning the IP address.

For example, in our example here PC1 known PC3's Layer 3 address, 192.168.1.3, but it doesn't know the Layer 2 address, its MAC address, yet. 

The ARP process consists of two messages:

The ARP request, sent by the device that wants to know the MAC address of the other device.

And the ARP reply, which is sent to inform the requesting device of the MAC address.

In our example, PC1 would send the ARP request, and PC3 would send the ARP reply.

The ARP request is sent as a broadcast ethernet frame. Broadcast means it is sent to all hosts on the network. Because the Layer 2 address of the destination host is unknown, it broadcasts the request and waits for a reply from the correct device.

The ARP reply is unicast. We learned about unicast frames in the last video.

A unicast frame is sent to only one host, in this case its the host that sent the ARP request. Let's take a look at how this works on our network.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TtIfriO.png)

Here at the bottom is the original frame that PC1 wants to send to PC3. But first, it has to send this frame. This is an ARP request frame. The source and destination IP addresses, as well as the source MAC address, are the same. However, look at the destination MAC address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is the broadcast MAC Address. This is the destination MAC address used when a device wants to send ethernet frames to all other devices on the local network. So, PC1 has prepared the ARP request to be sent. it sends the frame out of its network interface, and it is received by SW1. SW1 then adds PC1's MAC address to its MAC address table.

When a MAC address is learned in this way, what is it called ? It's called dynamic MAC address, which we learned in the last video. So, since the destination MAC address is all Fs, SW1 broadcasts the frame out of all its interfaces, except the one it was received on.

This is very much like what a switch does with an unknown unicast frame, which we also learned about last video.

It sends the frame out of G0/1 and G0/2, but not G0/0 because it received the frame on that interfaces.

PV2 received it, but it ignores the frame.

That's because the destination IP address doesn't match PC2's IP address, so it knows that the ARP request is meant for a different PC, so it just ignores the request.

Of course, then SW2 learns PC1's MAC address and adds it to the MAC address table, associating it with the G0/2 since that's the frame was received on.

Since the destination MAC address is the broadcast MAC address, SW2 also sends the frame out of all interfacem except the one the frame was received on. So, that means it sends the frame out of G0/0 and G0/1. PC4 ignores the frame, because the destination IP address doesn't match its own.

However, PC3 recognize that the destination IP address does match its own IP address, What it does is send the other ARP message I mentioned briefly, the ARP reply. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/admmqXJ.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ALBxMlx.png)

Here you can see the ARP reply packet.

The source IP is PC3's IP, and the destination is PC1's Ip.

The source MAC is PC3's MAC address, and the destination is PC1's

Although the ARP request message was a broadcast message, because PC1's MAC address was used as the source MAC address of the ARP request messeage, PC3 now knows PC1's MAC address so it can send the ARP reply directly to PC1, without having to broadcast the frame.

PC3 sends the frame out of its network interface, and it is received by SW2.

SW2 learns PC3's MAC address and enters it into the MAC address table, associting it with the G0/0 interfaces. Since this is a unicast frame, and SW2 already has an entry for the destination MAC address in its MAC address table, what kind of frame is this, and what does SW2 do with it ?

It's a known unicast frame, and SW2 will simply forward it out of the interface in the MAC table, it will not flood it like an unknown unicast frame or a broadcast frame.

Because SW2 learned PC1's MAC address on the G0/2 interface, it will send the frame out of that interface toward SW1. 

SW1 receives the frame, and since it has already learned PC1's MAC address on the G0/0 interface, it simply forwards the frame out of the interface, and PC1 finally receives the ARP reply.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RNzFBz3.png)

PC1 will then use that information to add an entry for PC3 to its ARP table, which is used to store these IP address to MAC address associations.

Let's take a look at an ARP table.

This is a screenshot of part of the ARP table from my PC

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eDWczlQ.png)

I use Windows on my PC, but you can the arp -a command to view the ARP table, whether you run Windows, macOS, or Linux on your computer. 

The Internet address column displays IP addresses. The physical address column displays the MAC addresses that correspond to the IP addresses. If the type column displays static, it means that it is a default entry, it wasn't actually learned by sending an ARP request.

However, if the type column displays dynamic, that means that the entry was learned by sending an ARP request and receiving an ARP reply. You can see one entry like that here, with an IP address of 192.168.0.1 and its MAC address next to it.

That's the address of my home router, by the way. Now let's take a deeper look at the MAC address table that is kept on these switches, and some additional information. I recreated the same topology in the network emulator software GNS3. GNS3 is similar to packet tracer in that it allows you to create network and practice configurations on Cisco devices, but its also diffrent in some key ways. 

Packet tracer is a network simulator, it's a piece of software designed to simulate the operation of a real network. 

GNS3, however, runs actual Cisco IOS software, so these are real Cisco switches running virually.

However, GNS3 requires you to purchases your own copies of Cisco IOS, although GNS3 itself is free, using Cisco IOS with GNS3 is not. That's why I choose to use packet tracer for the lab videos in this series, its totally free, and it lets you practice just about everything you need for the CCNA.

I also want to show you GNS3 sometimes in these videos, however, since you'll probably want to use it later as you progress in your networking studies.

Don' worry about using GNS3 for now though, unless you really want to try it out.

You can get it at gns3.com

So, here's our topology, and notice this magnifying glass here.

This is a cool feature of GNS3, it integrates with another piece of software called wireshark, and we'll use it to analyze exactly what traffic passes between PC1 and SW1.

I'm going to send a ping from PC1 to PC3.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/S4AAmSs.png)

The process is the same, but let me just run down one more time what happens.

Just like our example before, PC1 doesn't know the destination MAC address, so has to send an ARP request. The ARP request is sent to all other hosts on the network. 

PC3 responds to the ARP request, since it's IP address matches the destination IP address in the ARP request.

PC1 then learn the MAC request Address of PC3, adds it to its ARP table, and uses that information to add the destination MAC address to the ping it wants to send 

Now, before I move on, you may have heard of ping before, but let me explain how it works.

Ping is somethings you're going to be using a lot. It's a network utility that is used to test reachability, for example, to test if two computers can reach each other. It measures the round-trip time, for example the time from PC1 to PC3, then back to PC1. Muck like ARP, ping uses two messages: ICMP Echo request, and ICMP echo reply. Again, this is similar to an ARP request and ARP reply. However, the PC won't broadcast the ICMP echo request, it is sent to a specific host.

So, it has to know MAC address of the destination host, which is why ARP must be used first.

The command to use ping us ping , followed by the IP address you want to ping to, for example, 192.168.1.3 for PC3 in our network.

Let's take a look at the ping process.

So, I'm on PC1 here 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vpB1vol.png)

Note that this is actually the Cisco IOS CLI.

I'm using Cisco routers to simulate PCs, since it easier than setting up virtual PCs to ping in GNS3

I use the command ping 192.168.1.3, so send an ICMP echo request to PC3

Tale a look at this message here. Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP echos to 192.168.1.3

By default, a ping in Cisco IOS sends 5 icmp echo requests, and then you should get 5 icmp echo replies back, and the default size of each ping is 100 bytes.

The period indicates a failed ping, and the exclamation points indicate a successful ping. As it says here, success rate is 80 percent, 4 out of 5.

It also shows the round trip time, giving the minimum, average and maximum time of the 4 succesful pings. Now, why did that first ping fail ?

Well, that's because of ARP.

PC1 didn't know the destination MAC address, so it had to use ARP, and in that time the first ping failed.

After PC1 learned PC3's MAC address, however, the pings succeeded.

Let's take a quick look at the table here.

The command for windows, macos, and linux was arp -a.

However, in Cisco IOS its show arp, from privileged exec mode. Here's the ARP table.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eRGYAOO.png)

Notice there is an entry for 192.168.1.1, which is PC1 itself, and then below it 192.168.1.3, which is PC3.

This is a screenshot from Wireshark, which I mentioned earlier.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xvnnDpA.png)

Wiresharks allows you to perform what are called 'packet captures', to analyze the contents of network traffic.

Notice the Protocol column.

ARP, followed by ICMP, which is ping.

Here's the first ARP packet

The source MAC is 0c:2f:b0:11:9d:00, which is PC'1 MAC

The destination is broadcast, which is all Fs.

Look at the info on the end. Who has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1.

This describe what purpose of ARP is.

The ARP request is asking which MAC address has an IP address of 192.168.1.3, and to send the reply to itself, 192.168.1.1

Next is the ARP reply. The sourse address is 0c:2f:b0:6a:39:00 , PC3's MAC, and the destination is PC1's MAC. Look at the info section again here, 192.168.1.3 is 0c:2f:b0:6a:39:00, it's telling PC1 its MAC address. After that there are 4 ICMP echo requests, and 4 ICMP echo replies. Note that the ICMP echo requests have a source IP of PC1 and destination of PC3, and the ICMP echo replies have a source of PC3 and destination of PC1

I'll use wireshark at various point throughout this course, but I think you can see how useful it can be in analyzing networks.

Okay, hopefully you understand this process a little better now.

Basically, if device A wants to send traffic to device B. Which is on the same network, device A first has to use ARP to learn device B's MAC address, and then it can send traffic to device B. Now, let's finally 

Here it is This is the command to view it, show mac SPACE address HYPHEN table.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OoEL2sQ.png)

Old versions of Cisco IOS use show mac hyphen address hyphen table, but newer versions got rid of the first hyphen, and now its this, show mac space address hyphen table.

Now let's look at each section of the MAC address table, before I only showed the MAC address and interface. VLAN means Virtual local area network. We'll learn about those later, but as is displayed here the default is 1.

Next is the MAC address column, you can see PC1 up top and PC3 on the bottom, Next is the type. Remember what I said about dynamic mac address ? Well it displayed in the MAC address table as well.

Both of these MAC addresses we learned dynamically, I did not manually configure them on the switch.

Finally, ports, which is another word for interface.

So, you can see that this matches the small MAC address table I put here in this diagram.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rPHqKsM.png)

Here's the entry for PC1, and here's the entry to PC2

Now, I mentioned in the previous video that these dynamic MAC addresses are removed from the MAC address table after 5 minutes. If the switch doesn't get any traffic from the MAC address for 5 minutes, it will remove the entry from the MAC address table.

However, you can also manually remove MAC address from the table. Here I used the show mac address table command and you can see the entries for PC1 and PC3

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NCj0e7x.png)

Then I used the command clear mac address-table dynamic

As you can see, all of the dynamic MAC address have been cleared.

Remember this command clear mac address-table dynamic.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8sLFtj6.png)

Now, if you don't want to clear all of the mac address from the table, you can add some additional options to the command

Once again, I used show mac address-table and you can see both entries, for PC1 and PC3.

This time I used a different command, clear mac address-table dynamic address, followed by PC1's MAC address. Then if I use show mac address-table again, only PC3's MAC address can be seen

Here's the command once more

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ysTkZAF.png)

Clear mac address-table dynamic address, then the mac address

Again, show mac address-table shows both PC1 and PC3's MAC addresses.

This time I use the command clear mac address-table dynamic interface gi0/0. This clear all mac address table entries for a specific interface. As you can see, once again PC1's mac address is removed , because it is conneted to the G0/0 interface.

Clear mac address-table dynamic interface, and then the interface.

Before we move on to the quiz,  I want to show you a little more in wireshark, regarding what I said in the beginning of the video about the Ethernet frame.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/O2VR69t.png)

In this packet tracer I sent a 36-size ping with the command 'ping 192.168.1.3' SIZE 

First, notice the TYPE field down here

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YCfs1IO.png)

As I mentioned in the last video, IPv4's ethernet type is 0x8000. The 0x just means its using hexadecimal, so really its 0800.

Remember, the minimum payload size for an ethernet frame is 46 bytes, and I sent 36 byte pings, so these should be 10 bytes of padding Each hexadecimal digit is 4 bits, so 2 digits equal 8bits, 1 byte

If you count the zeroes, there are 20 zeroes, so that means 10 bytes of padding. If I zoom out a bit you can also see the padding down here. These ten pairs of zeroes are the 10 bytes of padding added to the 36-bytes pings to make them meet the 46-byte payload minimum size

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rvp8lud.png)

One last thing in wireshark. This time look at ARP. Remember, the IPv4 ethernet type is 0800, and the IPv6 ethernet type is 86DD. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dxXd9hq.png)

As you can see here, the ARP ethernet type of 0806. This indicate that an ARP packet is inside of this ethernet frame. Okay, so we covered a lot of important stuff in this video.

### Day 5,6 - Lab Analyzing Ethernet Switching 

As you can see, the network topology we will use in this lab is like the example network.

I used in those previous lecture videos , with two switches, each with 2 PCs connected to them

Let's get started and go through the steps.

First off, there is a note saying that both switches have an empty MAC address table, and all PCs have an empty ARP table

Keep that in mind as you try to answer step 1, which asks us, if PC1 pings to PC3, what messages will be sent over the network, and which devices will receive them ?

So, if PC1 wants to send a ping to PC3, it has to know PC3's MAC address. We can type ping 192.168.1.3 on PC1 to send a ping, but until PC1 knows PC3's MAC address, it can't send the ping. So, that's the first message. Now, which devices will receive the ARP request ? 

Well, the ARP request is a broadcast message, so ALL devices on the local network will receive it, except for PC1 of course, which sends the message. 

PC2 and PC4 will ignore the message, but then PC3 will send an ARP reply, which is the second message.

Unlike the ARP request, which is a broadcast message, the ARP reply is a unicast message,

so the message will be sent through SW2 and SW1, and then be received by PC1 only,no copies of the message will be sent to PC2 or PC4.

Then, PC1 will be able to add PC3's MAC address to its ARP table, and use that information as the destination address of its ping

So, the third message that will be sent is an ICMP echo request, from PC1.

This is a unicast message that will be received by PC3 only

Then , PC3 will send an ICMP echo reply, which is also a unicast message that will be received by PC1 only, after passing through SW2 and SW1 of course.

So, that's it, those are the message that will be sent over the network if PC1 pings PC3.

Now, there won't be just one ping, PC1 will send muiltiple pings, 4 by default from a windows

Step 2 asks us to send the ping and use Packet tracer's simulation mode to verify our answer.

First, let me click on simulation mode here in the bottom right.

Then, to send a ping from a PC in packet tracer, click on the PC, click on Desktop, and click on command prompt.

Immediately, you can see that both an ICMP message, the ping, and an ARP message appear.

I'll click on the ICMP message, and then click on Layer 2 . The next-hop address is unicast. The ARP process looks it up in the ARP table, but the next-hop IP address is not in the ARP table. The ARP process tries to send an ARP request for that IP address and buffers this packet.

Buffers means it holds the packet, so it can send it later.

Now, let's click on the ARP message, and look here at the information. This time, I'll click on 'Outbound PDU details', which shows us detailed information about the frame. Do you recognize these fields ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QVb7Rfs.png)

Preamble, SFD, destination address, source address, type, data, which is the encapsulated packet, and the FCS.

If you watched my last two videos, you should recognize all of these fields of the Ethernet.

Notice in particular the TYPE field of 0806, which indicates ARP, and the destination MAC address of all F's, which is the broadcast address.

Okay, now I'll exit from here and click through the process.. the ARP reaches SW1, is broadcast to PC2 and SW2, and then broadcast to PC3 and PC4. 

Only PC3 replies, this time with a unicast message which arrives at SW2, then SW1, and PC1 can then, finally, send its ICMP echo request, which is unicast and goes to SW1, PC3 then sends the ICMP echo reply back through SW2,SW1, and then arriving at PC1.

I'll just press this play button, and you can see the rest of the pings being sent between PC1 and PC3.

There should be 4 in total, as thess Packet Tracer PCs operate like window PCs.

Cisco devices, however, send 5 pings by default.

Now, step 3 tells us to generate network traffic and allow the switches to learn all MAC address of the PCs

Remember, switches dynamically learn and enter MAC addresses into their MAC address table by looking at the source address field of frames they receive

So, since we just pinged between PC1 and PC3, both swithces should know their MAC addresses, but just in case i'll switch back to realtime mode... and send one more ping from PC1 to PC3.

Because sometimes Packet Tracer has problems with simulation mode.

Okay, next let's send a ping from PC2 to PC4 so that the switches can learn their MAC addresses.

Step 4 asks us to use show commands on the switches to identify the MAC address of each PC.

Because the interface each PC is connected to is displayed on the network diagram, if we look for that interface in the MAC table we will be able to identify the MAC address of each PC.

I'll go on SW1.

We have to be in privileged exec mode to view the MAC address table.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/h7v5AGa.png)

Okay, first of all let's find PC1, which is attached to the fastethernet 0/1 interface.

Here it is, and you can see the MAC address here.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hhXgBTb.png)

Note that the MAC address in your lab maybe different,I'm not sure if packet tracer keeps the MAC address consistent if you load the labs up on another computer. Well, its connected to Fastethernet 0/2, so here is PC2's MAC address.

Now , as for PC3 and PC4, we have a problem

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BRNU78Y.png)

SW1 only knows that it can reach these two MAC addresses via gigabit ethernet 0/1.

Just by looking at this MAC table, we don't know which address belongs to PC3 and which belongs to PC4,

So let's go in SW2. Once again, I'll enter privileged exec mode, enable. 

PC3 is connected to fastethernet 0/1, so this must be its MAC address, and PC4 is connected to fasterthernet 0/2, so this must be its MAC address of each PC.

Now let's do step 5, which is to clear the dynamic MAC address from the mac address table. Since i'm already on SW2, I'll start here . The command is clear mac address-table dynamic, but before I hit enter, I want to show you something

I'll use the question mark, which is also known as 'context-sensitive' help

As you can see, it doesn't display any additional options here.

If you remember from the day 6 lecture video when I did the demonstration in GNS3 I could clear specific MAC addresses by specifying the addres or interface.

Packet tracer,  however, does not support this option, you have to clear all MAC addresses.

So I enter the command, then i'll use the up arrow on the keyboard to go to back the show mac address-table command, enter it once more, and you can see the mac address-table is now empty. Clear mac address-table dynamic . Press the up arrow twice to go back the show mac address-table command, hit enter, and there we go, the address table is now empty. 

-------------------------------------------------------

### Part 7: IPv4 Addressing - Part 1

This is the 7th lecture in the series. In the past couple videos we talked about Ethernet LAN switching, for example within this small network of PCs, attached to a switch. In this video, however, we'll start to expand our horizon, and take a look at how traffic is forwarded not within a LAN, but between different LANs. Basically, we are going up the OSI model from Layer 2, the data link layer, to Layer 3, the network layer. Let's do a quick review of Layer 3. This slide is from Day 3's video on the OSI model. Let's review some characteristics of Layer 3, the Network layer. The network layer provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks, outside of the local area network. Layer 3 provides logical addressing, specifically IP addresses. Where Layer 2 uses MAC addresses, which are assigned to the device when it is made, IP addresses are logical addresses you assign when you configure the device. Layer 3 provideds path selection between source and destination. Over larger, more complex networks, for example the Internet, there can be many different possoble paths to a destination. Selecting the best path to the destination is part of Layer 3's functionality. Routers operate at Layer 3. So far in this course we haven't talked much about routers. That's going to change over these next few videos, however, as we talk about Layer 3. In this video, our focus will be specifically on the Logical Layer 3 addresses, IP addresses. You may recognize this network from the previous videos on Ethernet LAN switching. These PCs are all connected by switches, so they are part of the same network. These Layer 2 devices, switches, do not separate different networks. They connect and expand networks. I could connect two more switches, each with multiple PCs connected to them, to this network, and it would still be one network, one LAN. Because of this, the PCs all have IP addresses in the same Layer 3 network, 192.168.1.0/24. PC1's IP address is 192.168.1.1, PC2's IP address is 192.168.1.2, PC3's IP address is 192.168.1.3, and PC4's IP address is 192.168.1.4. If PC1 sends a broadcast frame with a destination MAC address of all Fs, 

After SW1 receives the frame, it will broadcast it out all of its interface except the so that means G0/1 and G0/2. SW2 will then do the same with the frame, broadcasting it out of all of its interfaces, except the one it was received on so that mean G0/0 and G0/1. As you can see , all other PCs in the network have received the frame. Now, what if I put a router between SW1 and SW2 ?

Now I've put R1 in between the two switches. Now instead of one network, the PCs have been split into two networks. Let's say SW1, PC1 and PC2 are still on the 192.168.1.0/24 network, but now SW2, PC3 and PC4 are on the 192.168.2.0/24 network, with PC3 being 192.168.2.1 network, but now SW2, PC3 and PC4 are on the 192.168.2.0/24 network, with PC3 being 192.168.2.1 and PC4 being 192.168.2.2. You may have noticed that, in these network IP addresses, the first three groups of numbers, 192.168.1, and 192.168.2, represent of the network itself, and only this last 0 changes to represent the end hosts on the network, the PCs. You may also have wondered what these /24s mean at the end.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XJAbW5c.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/D4GXP0C.png)

Actually, they are used to tell what part of the address represents the network, and which part represent the end hosts, the PCs. /24 means that the first 3 groups of numbers represent the network. In this video, I'm going to go in depth about how these IP addresses work. But first, there's one more thing missing in this network diagram. The router needs an IP address. Actually, not just one IP address, it needs an IP address for each network it is connected to. So, let's give R1's G0/0 interface an IP address of 192.168.1.254, and it's G0/1 interface an IP address of 192.168.2.254.

This time, if R1 sends a frame to the broadcast MAC address of all Fs, SW1 will receive the frame, and it will forward it out of all of interfaces except the one the frame was received on. So, it sends the frame out of G0/1 and G0/2, and PC2 and R1 receive the frame. However, that's where it ends. The broadcast is limited to the local network, it doesn't cross the router and go to SW2,PC3 and PC4. I'll go more into detail about routing and layer 3 forwarding, but as I said, this video will focus on IP addresses themselves, so let's take a look.

This is a chart from Wikipedia showing the IP version 4 header or Internet Protocol, is the primary 3 protocol in use today and version 4 is the version in use of most network

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZjzCfn5.png)

As you can see, there are a lot of different fields in the IPv4 header, more than in the Ethernet header. We'll talk more about the IPv4 header in another video, so today let's look at these two fields, the source IP address and destination IP address. These field are both 32-bits in length, as you can see thet stretch from 0 to 31 in this chart. So, IP address are 32-bits, or 4 bytes, in length. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/um4Oiav.png)

Let's take a look at this IPv4 address, 192.168.1.254. An IPv4 address is 32 bits long. 192 represents 8 bits, 168 represents 8 bits, and 254 also represents 8 bits. If we write these 8 bits out as 1s and 0s, 192 is 11 00 00 00, 168 is 10 10 10 00, 1 is 00 00 00 01, and 254 is 11 11 11 10. This way of writing numbers using just 0s and 1s is called binary. However, binary is difficult to read and understand for us humans, so IP addresses are written using what's called dotted decimal, because they are four decimal number, 192,168,1 and 254, separated by dots, or periods. Let's spend some time learning about binary, which is important to understand IPv4 addresses.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SqaLKTX.png)

Before looking at binary, let's review decimal and hexadecimal. In decimal, also known as base 10, each digit by a factor of 10. For example, this number 3294 consists of 1 unit of 4, 9 units of 10, 2 units of 100, 3 units of 1000. Notice that they increase by a factor of 10.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VrAKZfS.png)

So, looking back at this IP address 192.168.1.254, let's look at how each of these number is written in binary, starting with 192, which is 11 00 00 00. Binary is base 2, meaning each digit increases by a factor of 2, it doubles. So, that means that this 11 00 00 00 really is 0 1s, then 1*2 is 2, so 0 2s, then 2 x 2 is 4, ...

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jQ8GTbI.png)

Next, let's look at how 168 is converted to binary, which is 10 10 10 00. So, 10 10 10 00 is binary means 1 unit of 128, 1 unit of 8,...

...

So, hopefully you have an idea of how binary works now. Before we do some practice converting between decimal and binary, I want to teach you more term. Yoo'll often hear each of these 8 bit groups referred to as 'octets'. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/85ZFIy1.png)

Now, let's get some practice converting binary octets to decimal.

Here's an example. We have a binary octet of 10 00 11 11 . How can we go about converting this to decimal ? First, I recommend writing the value of each binary digit over the binary numbers. You can start with 1 on the right, and then multiply by 2 for each digit as you move to the left. Or if you prefer, start by writing 128 over the digit on the left, and devide by 2 as you move to the right. Once you have written these value, simply add up the value of each 1, and you get the answer. 128+8+4+2+1 equals 143. So, binary 10 00 11 11 is equal to decimal 143. Let's do another example.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NOTXHLA.png)

Đoạn này nói về chuyển đổi giữa số thập phân và số nhị phân

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ULOtK8I.png)

However, you may remember there was this /24 that I said was used to identify which part of the IP address represents the network and which represents the end host. Since an IP address is 32 bits, can you guess what this /24 means? It means that the first 24 bits of this IP address represent the network portion of the address, and the remaining 8 represent the end host. So, the first 24 bits is equal to the first 3 octets, because 8+8+8 equals 24. So 192.168.1 is the network portion of the address, and 254 is the host portion. 

Here's a quick look back at our small network. The IP address of PC1, PC2 and R1's G0/0, interface are 192.168.1.1/24,192.168.1.2/24,192.168.1.254/24. Notice that the network portion of each IP address the same, because they are all part of the same local network, only the host portion is different. Like wise, the IP address of PC3, PC4 and R1's G0/1 interface are 192.168.2.1/24, 192.168.2.2/24, and 192.168.2.254/24, only the host portion of the address is different because they are on the same local area network.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aPIW6fc.png)

Let's follow the same process as before with another IP address. If you want some extra practice, try to convert these 32 binary bits into an IPv4 address. Pause the video if you want to try to find the answer on your own. Okay, so the 32 bits can be split into 4 octec like this. Then the four octets can be converted into dotted decimal like this. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oD5BH0f.png)

This time, /16 is used instead of /24. Which portion is the network portion and which is the host portion? Well, /16 means the first 16 bits, or the first half, are the network portion. So, the first two octets are the network portion, and the last two octets are the host portion. Therefore, 154.78 is the network portion, and 111.32 is the host portion. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eBCKiO2.png)

Let's do one more example.

Here's another IPv4 address. Try to convert these 32 bits into dotted decimal. Pause the video now if you want to try. Okay, so you can devide the 32 bits into 4 octets like this, and then convert the octets into dotted decimal like this. This time, it's /8. So which part of the address is the network portion, and which is the host portion ?

Since the first 8 bits are the network portion, that means the first octet is the network portion, and the last three octets are the host portion. So 12 is the network portion, and 128.251.23 is the host portion.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/i20Lp03.png)

Now, IPv4 addresses are split up into 5 different classes. The class of an IPv4 address is determined by the first octet of the address. The first is class A, which has a first octet beginning with 0. If the first octet begins with 0 , that means that the numeric range of the first octet is from 0 to 127, because 64+32+16+8+4+2+1 gives a maximum of 127. The second class is class B, which has a first octet beginning with 10, and therefore a numeric range of 128 to 191. The third class is class C, which has a first octet beginning with 110, and therefore the numeric range of the first octet is 192 to 223. ...

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jKbNGJr.png)

However, the classes of address we'll be focusing on are A,B and C. Addresses in class D are reserved for 'multicast' addresses. Multicast is another type of address, separate from the unicast and broadcast addresses we talked about in the previous videos. We will talk about them, but that will be later in the course. Class E addresses are reserved for experimental uses, and we don't talk about them in this course. Now, one more thing about the class A range. The end of the class A is usually considered to be 126, not 127. Why is that ? Let's take a look.

The 127 range is reserved for 'loopback' addresses. The range is anything with a first octet os 127, so 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255. These addresses are used to test the 'network stack' of the local device. If a device sends any network traffic to an address in this range, it is simply processes back up the TCP/IP stack as if it were traffic received from another device. In this image, I pinged 127.0.0.1 on my windows PC, and you can see the response. My PC is responding to its own pings. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3gyrkcB.png)

In this image, I sent to a random IP address in the 127 range, 127.23.68.241, and again my PC responds back to its own ping.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GmWbRZU.png)

Notice, the round trip times, all 0 milliseconds. That's because the traffic isn't going anywhere, my PC is just sending and receving these pings to and from itself.

So, here's the chart again with just classes A,B and C. I've also added one more column, the prefix length which is /8,/16 and /24 which is used to identify the length of net network portion of the address. Class A addresses use a /8 prefix, Class B addresses use a /16 prefix, and Class C addresses use a /24 prefix.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qbiS8W7.png)

Actually, if you look back at these three addresses we used in our examples, you can see they are, Class A, Class B and Class C addresses, and their prefix lengths match the table. ./8 for class A, /16 for class B, and /24 for class C. In class A, there are fewer possible network addresses, however because the network (*host) portion is very long, there can be many hosts on each network. Class C is the opppsite, there are many more possible networks, but because the host portion is smaller there are fewer hosts on each network. So, this is another chart I've taken off of wikipedia. The leadning bits column refers to the first bits of the first octet, which I displayed in my previous table. The size of network number bit field displayed the number of bits in the network portion of the IP address, which as I mentioned is 8 for class A, 16 for class B, and 24 for class C. Size of rest bit field indicates the remaining number of bits in the address, which is the host portion of the addresses. 24 bits for class A, 16 for class B, and 8 for class C.

Now, this part here displays the number of possible networks in each class. As I said, class A has fewer potential networks, but more hosts in each network, class C is the opposite, and class B is in between. Class A has 128 possible networks, Class B has about 16000 networks and class C has about 2 million networks. Class A allows about 16.7 million hosts in each network. Class B allow about 65000 hosts in each network, and Class C allows 256 hosts in each network. However, because the first address in each network is the network address, it can be assigned to hosts. Also the last address of the network is the broadcast address, the Layer 3 address used when you want to send traffic to all hosts, and it also can't be assigned to hosts, so really the host count is two less, for example 254 in class C. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UMUqS6b.png)

Now I want to briefly talk about another way of writing these prefix lengths. Using a slash, followed by the length of the prefix, is a newer and easier way of writing the prefix length. On Juniper network devices, for example, you write prefix lengths using this slash notation. However, Cisco devices still use an older, slightly more complicated way of writing the prefix length. That is using a dotted decimal netmask. A netmask is written in dotted decimal like an IP address, where the network portion is all 1s and the host portion is all 0s. For example, the network mask of a class A address is 255.0.0.0. That's the dotted decimal version of 11 11 11 11 , followed by 24 zeros. So, what do you think the netmask of a class B is ? ... It's 255.255.0.0, which is two octets of 1s, followed by two octecs of zeroes, written in dotted decimal. Finally, what do you think the netmask of a class C address is? It's 255.255.255.0, which is three octets of 1s, followed by 1 octet of zeroes, again written in dotted decimal notation. So, these prefix lengths and these netmask are the same thing, just written in different ways. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xiDiFLe.png)

Ip addresses which I briefly mentioned before, the network and broadcast addresses. If the host portion of an IP address is all 0's , it means it is the network address, the identifier of the network itself. In our diagram here, you can see 192.168.1.0/24. We know that /24 means the first three octets are the network portion, and the last octet is the host portion. Since, the host portion is 0, it means the last octet, the host portion, is all 0s. Therefore, this address, 192.168.1.0/24 is the network address. Keep in mind, the network address cannot be assigned to a host. The network address is the first address of the network, but the first USABLE address is one above the network address, in this case it's 192.168.1.1, which is assigned to PC1. So, the network address is the first address, with a host portion of all 0s. However, the last address in a network, with a host portion of all 1s, is the broadcast address for the network. Like the network address, the broadcast address cannot be assigned to a host. So although it's the last address in the network the last USABLE address is actually 1 under the broadcast address, in this case, that's 192.168.1.254, the address assigned to R1's , So, the broadcast address is the layer 3 address used to send a packet to all hosts on the local network. If a packet is sent with this destination IP address, what do you think will be the destination MAC address of the frame it is encapsulated in ? Think about the Ethernet LAN switching videos .. it will be all F's, the broadcast MAC address. If PC1, for example, sent a ping to 192.168.1.255, it would be received by PC2 and R1's G0/0 interface.

Once again, I think we've covered a lot of ground in this video. Let's list what we covered before moving on to today's quiz. First, I talked about dotted decimal and binary. Binary is how computers think, but 32 bit Ipv4 addresses are difficult to remember for us humans, so we convert IPv4 address to dotted decimal form to make them eaiser to read and remember. You learned that IPv4 addresses consist of a network portion and a host portion . Hosts on the same network will have the same network portion, but a unique host portion of their IP addresses. You learned about the IPv4 address classes. We looked at the different ways of indicating the length of the network prefix, by writing the prefix length with a slash or by using a netmask. And finally, you learned about the network address, which as a host portion of all 0s, and to identify the network itself, not any particular host on the network. Also, the broadcast address, which has a host portion of all 1s, which is used to send network traffic to all hosts on the network.

### Day 8 - IPv4 Addressing - P2

Let's go over what we'll cover in this video. I'll do a quick review of IPv4 classes, and clarify some things I didn't explain well in the previous video. I'll explain how to find the maximum number of hosts, the network address, the broadcast address, the first usable address, and the last usable address of a particular network. I introduced some of these in the previuous video, but its worth explaining in more detail. Finally, I will outline how to configure IP address on Cisco devices, which we'll then practice in packet tracer, in the next video.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bouYg9j.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Fzex2pF.png)

So this is the chart of the IPv4 address classes I showed you in the last video. I taugh you that the 127 range is reserved for loopback addresses, so its generally not considered part of the Class A range.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dZEyXk4.png)

So some might say class A really begins at 1, making the range 1-126. Different sources say different things, so I recommend that you remember class A as 0-127, but also keep in mind that 0 and 127 are reserved, so really the usable range is 1-126. 

We also saw this chart from wikipedia in the last video. Leading bits of 0 for class A, 10 for class B, and 110 for class C. A network number bit field size, also known as prefix length, 0f 8 class A, 16 for class B, and 24 for class C. A size of 'rest bit field' also known as the host portion of the address, of 24 bits for class A, 16 for class B, and 8 for class C. The number of networks available in each class. And finally, the number of address pernetwork. This is the maximum number of addresses, including the network address and broadcast address. Notice, how it's calculated .2, to the power, of 8,16 or 24 that being the length of the host portion. But let's look at how to calculate the maximum number of USABLE addresses, the number of addresses that can be assigned to hosts. So, let's take this class C newwork 192.168.1.0/24. Because it's class C, it uses a /24 prefix length, and therefore the last octet, the last 8 bits, are the host portion. That means that host portion can be 0 to 255. So, 0 to 255 gives us a total of 256 addresses which is 2 to the power of 8, because there are 8 bits. But, remember those two special address types I mentioned in the last video ? If th host portion is all 0s, it represents the network address, sometimes called the network ID. It can't be assigned to a host. Also, if the host portion is all 1s, it is the network broadcast address, the address used to send a message to all hosts on the network. It also can't be assigned to a host. So, actually the maximum hosts per network is 2 to the power of 8, minus 2, which is 254 for a class C network like this.

Now let's take a look at this class B network, 172.16.0.0/16, through 172.16.255.255. The host portion is 16 bits, giving 65536 possible addresses. However, this address with a host portion of all 0s is the network address, and this address with a host portion of all 1s is the broadcast address, so really the maximum number of hosts in the network, or any class B network, is 65534. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rprAil6.png)

Now, let's do one more example, with a class A address. 10.0.0.0/8, through 10.255.255.255. The host portion is 24 bits, so that gives 16777216 possible addresses. This network address and this broadcast address can't be assigned to hosts, however, so the maximum number of hosts in this network or any class A network is really 16777214. So, the formula for determing the number of hosts on a network is 2 to the power of N, minus 2. N is equal to the number of host bits.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V7UUGFR.png)

Now let's calculate the first and last usable addresses for this class C network, 192.168.1.0/24. So, this address with a host portion of all 0s is the network address, or network ID. Add 1 by changing the last bit of the host portion to 1 and you get 192.168.1.1, and that is first usable address in the network. So, that's how you do it. Add one to the network address to get the first usable address. How about the last usable address ? Well, this address with a host portion of all 1s is the broadcast address. Subtract 1 from this address by switching the last bit to 0, and you get 192.168.1.254, which is the last usable address. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3YzBUWb.png)

Next let's do the same for this class B network, 172.16.0.0/16. This address with a host portion of all 0s is the network address. Add 1 and you get 172.16.0.1, and that is the first usable address on the network. How about the last usable address ? This address with a host portion of all 1s is the broadcast address. Subtract 1 from this address, and you get 172.16.255.254, and that is the last usable address.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pkdKHcN.png)

Finally let's do the same for this class. A network, 10.0.0.0/8. This address is the network address. Add 1 and, you get 10.0.0.1, and that is the first usable address on the network. Next let's find the last usable address. This address with a host portion of all 1s is the broadcast address. Subtract 1, and you get 10.255.255.254, which is the last usable address. Okay, so hopefully you understand both how to calculate the number of usable addresses in a network, and the first and last usable address in a network. Really, we covered this matetial in the last video, but I wanted to make it clear. Now let's move on actually configuring a Cisco router with IP addresses !

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jtIaj2X.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CW6sDbw.png)

So here's a small network I put together in GNS3, with three small networks connected to a single router, R1. Keep in mind that, it's not really realistics to have only a single PC connected to each switch, in a real network there would many more hosts and possibly more switches in each local area network. So, we have one class A network here, 10.0.0.0/8.PC1 has the first usable address in the network, 10.0.0.1 and we will assign the last usable address, 10.255.255.254, to R1's gigabit 0/0 interface. We have this class B network, 172.16.0.0/16. PC2 has the first the usable IP address, 172.16.0.1, and we will assign the last usable address, 172.16.255.254, to R1's gigabit 0/1 interfaces. We also have a class C network, 192.168.0.0/24. PC3 has the first usable address, 192.168.0.1 and we will assign the last usable address, 192.168.0.254, to R1's gigabit 0/2 inteface. Let's go into the CLI of R1 and make the configurations. So, I logged on to the CLI of R1, and as you can see I used 'EN'; the shortcut of the enable command, to enter privileged exec mode. Now, let me show you a great command you can use to confirm the status of interface on the device, as well as their IP addresses. That is the 'show ip interface brief' command. Let's check out the info this command gives us. First off, the interface column lists the network interfaces on the device. As you can see, this router has four interfaces, gigabiterthernet 0/0,0/1,0/2 and 0/3. The next column lists the IP address of each interface. As you can see, they are all unassigned at the moment, but we will soon assign IP address to the top three interfaces. We'll use this command again afterward to check. Next is the 'OK' column. I think this is a legacy feature of the command, its not relevant anymore. Basically, it says whether or not the IP address is valid or not. On moderm devices, the device won't let you assign invalid addresses, so you should never see 'NO' in this column. The interface currently have no IP addresses assigned, and as you can see, that is considered a valid state. Next is the method column. This indicates the method by which the interface was assigned an IP address. Currently the status is unset, but let's check what it is after we assign IP addresses. Next is the status column. Basically, you can consider this the Layer 1 status of the interface. If the interface is enabled, there is a cable connected, and the other end of the cable os properly connected to another device, you should see 'up' here. However, here it displays 'administratively down'. This means the interface has been disabled with the 'shutdown' command. However, I haven't done any configuration on the interfaces yet.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CKRZfGQ.png)

So, this is the default status of Cisco router interfaces. We haven't looked at switch interfaces yet, but Cisco switch interfaces are NOT administratively down by default. They will either be up, if they are connected to another device, or down, if they are not connected. Notice that, even though gigabit ethernet 0/0,0/1 and 0/2 on this router are connected to switches, the interfaces remain administratively down because the 'shutdown' command is applied to them by default. The final field of the output is 'protocol'. While the 'status' column referred to the Layer 1 status of the interface, this is the Layer2 status. Because the interfaces are down at Layer 1, layer 2 can't operate. So all of these interfaces are down at Layer 2. You'll never see an interface with a 'down' in the status column and 'up' in the protocol column, although the reserve is possible. Once we configure these interfaces and enable them, we should see up in both the status and protocol columns. So, remember these point, the 'status' column refers to the Layer 1 status, for example is the interface shutdown, is there a cable attached, etc.

The protocol column refers to the layer 2 status, for example is Ethernet functioning properly between this device and the device it's connected to. Expect both of these columns to show up. So, let's configure the gigabitethernet 0/0 interface first. I use conf t, the shortcut of the 'configure terminal' command to enter global config mode. Next, to configure the interface itself, I have to enter interface config mode. So, I use the command 'interface', followed by the name of the interface, gigabitethernet 0/0. As you can see, it now displays config-if beside the hostname of the device. Now , before we move on, let me show you some other ways to enter interface configuration mode. First off, notice that you don't need the space between 'gigabitethernet' and 0/0, you can connect them and CLI will still understand and bring you to interface configuration mode for that interface. Now, how about the shortcut version of the command ? Well, as you can see, there are many possible commands beginning with 'i' from global config mode, so that's too short. However, there is only one option beginning with 'in', so that 's the shortest version of the command. Keep in mind, you don't have to use or even remember what the shortest version of each command is. For example I always type 'int' for interface, even though 'in' would work too. Just use whatever is comfortable for you. It may even help you remeber the commands if you type the whole thing out every time. Okay, now how about the short version of gigabitethernet ? 

Well, as you can see there are multiple options with just G, so you might think that's too short. However, here's something cool. if you type the 0/0 after the G, it works ! The CLI will understand and bring you into interface configuration mode for gigabitethernet 0/0. Whether you prefer to use shortcuts to maximize efficiency, or take your time and tyoe out the whole command, remember that the command to enter interface configuration mode is 'interface', followed by the interface name.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zwW5MiC.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DgXtqgD.png)

Now that we're in interface configuration mode, let's set the IP address. That is done with the command IP address, and then you type the IP address. Notice I used the context-sensitive help, the question mark, to display the next option, and it is the 'netmask' I referred to in a previous video. As opposed to writing /8 for this class. A address, we will have to write out the subnet mask in dotted decimal. For those of you who have heard of the term 'subnet' or 'subnetting' before, don't worry. We'll cover those topics in depth soom in separate videos, so you may remember /8 is equivalent to 255.0.0.0, /8 means that the first bits are all set to 1, and a binary octet of all 1s is written as 255 in decimal. Next I enter the command 'no shutdown'. This is the command we use to enable the interface. Remember I said that Cisco router interface have the 'shutdown' command applied to them by default ? Well, to cancel the command, type 'no' in front of the command like this. Now that we are entered the no shutdown command on the interface, we get two message on the device. The first one says 'interface gigabitethernet0/0', changed state to up. This refers to the physical layer status of the interface, the 'STATUS' column of the show ip interface brief command we looked at. The second message says 'Line protocol on interface gigabitethernet 0/0', changed state to up'. This is the layer 2 status of the interface, the 'protocol' column of the show ip interface brief command. So, now if we take a look at the show ip interface brief command, both of those column should display up. Lets check. Here I use 'do' to let me execute this privileged exec mode command from interface config mode, and notice I used shortcuts instead , sh ip int br, instead of show ip interface brief. As you can see, we can now see the IP address, the method is displayed as manual instead of unset, and both the status and protocol display up. Seems like our interface configuration was a success !

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8aYHiBL.png)

Let's do the configuration for the G0/1 interface next. I'll give it an address of 172.16.255.254. The prefix length is /16, so what will the subnet mask be ? So, I use the int g0/1 command to enter interface config mode for the interface. Notice that I didn't type 'exit' to return to global config mode and then type int g0/1. You can directly switch from one interface to the other. Next I configure the IP address, using the shortcut 'add' for address. Notice the subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, which indicates a prefix length of /16. Then I enable the interface with 'no shut', which is a short version of the no shutdown command. Once again, I get two messages saying the interface has come up. Then I check the interface again with show ip interface brief, and you can see that gigabitethernet 0/1 has an IP address, and its status is up. 

Finally, let's configure R1's g0/2 interface with an IP address of 192.168.0.254. The prefix length is /24, so what do you think the subnet maks will be ?

So, I use 'int g0/2' to enter interface config mode for gigabitethernet 0/2. Then I configure an IP address of 192.168.0.254, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, which is equivalen to a prefix length of /24. I enable the interface with 'no shut', and once again I get the two messages indicating the interface has come up, and then once more I check the status of the interfaces with show ip interface brief. Looks like all of the interface have been properly configured. Their IP addresses are displayes, their method column displays 'manual', since I manually configired their IP address, and their status and protocol columns show up and up. Before finishing , I want to introduce some more 'show' commands that can be used to check out the interfaces on a Cisco device.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/puFFGLx.png)

First up is the 'show interfaces' command. You can enter just 'show interfaces', but it shows a lot of information for each interface, so I recommend specifying which interface you want to check, in this case I specified G0/0. This command shows primarily Layer 1 and Layer 2 information about the interface, but also some Layer 3. Gigabitethernet 0/0 is up, that means that Layer 1 is working. Line protocol is up, that refers to the layer 2 status of the interface. This line is like the status and protocol columns of the 'show ip interface brief' command. Hardware is 1Gbe, meaning 1 gigabit ethernet, address is 0c1b.8444.f000. That's the MAC address of this interface. Notice it says BIA, followed by the MAC address again. I mentioned in a previous video that the MAC address can also be called the burned in address. Well, thats what BIA stands for. Why is it listed twice ? Well, BIA refers to the actual physical address of the interface. However, you can actually configure a different MAC address in the CLI, although usually you won't configure a different MAC address. Internet address is 10.255.255.254/8. This is the IP address, of course. Feel free to take a look at the rest of this information if you want, but I'll explain more of it in detail in a later video. It's all detailed Layer 1 and Layer 2 information about the interface. 

Now let's look at one more valuable command. 'show interface description'. Well, as you can see it has status and protocol columns like the show ip interface brief command. But it also has this 'description' column. Interface description are optional, but can be very helpful in identifying the purpose of each interface. Let's quickly go back and configure description on each of these interfaces. So, from global config mode I once again entered interface config mode for G0/0. The command to configure an interface description is simply 'description', followed by the description.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kyypbk9.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5h5iURf.png)

Now, there aren't any rules regarding how to describe your interfaces. I use hashtags to make the description more noticeable and then I indicate which device the interface is connected to. I do the same for G0/1 and G0/2, using 'DESC' instead of the full descrption command. I then use the show interfaces description command again, and now you can see the description of each interface. Now, there are many more 'show' commands you can use to obtain information about a device's interfaces. We'll take a look at a few more throughout this course, but for now remember 'show ip interface brief','show interfaces', and 'show interfaces descrption'.

Now let's review what we recovered. This is the same silde I showed at the beginning of the video, but let's go through and make sure we covered everything. We covered IPv4 address classes, which we also covered in Part 1, but reviewed in this video. We talked about how to find the maximum number of hosts, network address, broadcast address, first usable address, and last usable address of a particular network. If you're not sure about any of those, go back and listen to that part of the video once more before moving on today's quiz. Finally, I showed you how to configure IP addresses on Cisco devices, as well as some 'show' commands to gather information about interfaces.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 8 - Lab - Configuring IP Addresses.

This is like the demo topology I used in Day 8's main video, I just changed the IP addresses. We still have one class A network, 15.0.0.0/8, one class B network, 182.98.0.0/16, and one class C network, 201.191.20.0/24. Let's get started.

I haven't done any configurations yet on R1, so it still has the default hostname of router. Let's go on to the CLI of R1.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Mr7YSzY.png)

Then, to configure the hostname, we have to be in global config mode, so 'conf t' . Now let's set the hostname 

hostname R1

Okay, you can see the prompt changes to display the new hostname

That's all for step 1

Step 2 is to use a 'show' command to view a list of R1's interfaces, their IP addresses.

Do you remember what command that is ?

It's a very helpful command which you'll use a lot as you configure Cisco routers.

But as you can see, the command doesn't work. 

Well, its because 'show' command are normally done from privileged exec mode.

However, let me use the 'up' arrow to return to the previous command, then I'll use the shortcut 'control A', so hold the control key, so hold the control key and press A and then cursor returns to the beginning of the line. Then, type 'do' in front of the command, and now it lets me enter the command from global config mode. Now you can see a list of interfaces, their IP addresses, which are unset at the moment, and their statues. Remember, the 'status' column indicates the Layer 1 status.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rKckwRx.png)

Currently their status is administratively down, because Cisco router interfaces have the 'shutdown' command applied to them by default.

The protocol column indicates the layer 2 status of the interface.

Because layer 1 is shutdown, layer 2 can't operate, so they are all down. We will configure gigabitethernet 0/0,0/1, and 0/2 in this lab, so they should all become up, up afterwards. Step 3 is to configure the appropriate IP address on R1's interface, and enable them. Let's start on the gigabitethernet 0/0 interface. Interface gigabitethernet 0/0. There we go, as you can see the prompt has changed to show that I'm in interface configuration mode. Once again, I'll use the full commands for the first interface. Ip address 15.255.255.254, now what's the appropriate subnet mask for a /8 prefix length ?

I'll indicate that this interface is connected to switch 1.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SupoVPa.png)

Description, I'll put two hashtags, to SW1, and then again, hashtags. You can use different description if you want, this is just how I do descriptions. 

No shutdown

Immediately, I get two message indicating that the interface has come up .

Before checking on the status of the interface, I'll configure the other two interfaces.

To switch to configuring another interface, I don't have to exit back to global config mode first. I can just type interface g0/1, and now I'm in interface config mode for gigabitethernet. Let's set the IP address. IP address 182.98.255.254. The subnet mask for a /16 prefix length is 255.255.0.0. Add the descrition 

Description ## to SW2 ##. Let's enable it.

Okay, now let's go to the last interface.

Int g0/2

Ip address 201.191.20.254 and the subnet mask for a /24 prefix length is 255.255.255.0. 

Description ## to SW3 ##. Finally, let's enable it.

OKay, since we're done with the configuration. I'll use the command 'end' to go back.

Alternatively, I could have used the 'exit' command twice.

Once to return to global config mode, and then a second time to return to privileged exec mode.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1pFmWne.png)

Now you can see the IP addresses we configured, the method lists 'manual' instead of unset, and the layer 1 and layer 2 of the interface are up and up.

Now, step 5 says to view the running config to confirm the changes, and then save the show running-config

You can see the description, and ip addresses we configured.

Notice the default duplex auto and speed auto commands.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/H1o0Jvr.png)

Also, if you look at the vlan1 interfac, you can see the shutdown command, which as I said is applied by default to cisco router interfaces. I mentioned in a previous video that there are a few ways to save the config.

Copy running-config startup-config 

write mem or just wr

I like to use the shortcut version of write, WR. There we go

Step 6 is to configure the IP address of PC1, PC2 and PC3.

I'll go on PC1 first. To configure the IP address, click config up here.

First, notice that I pre-configured the gateway here.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OwCF9uc.png)

I'll talk about the purpose of the gateway is when we talk more about routing, but notice that its R1's IP address.

Now, to configure the PC's IP address, click on fastethernet0 here, that is PC1's network.

And then here you can configure the IP address.

And look at the subnet mask. It automaticlly fills in 255.0.0.0, since this is a class A address.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RRSqFRc.png)

Okay, now we can exit out of here. Click on PC2 , click on fastethernet0. The IP address is 182.98.0.1 and once again it automatically fills in the subnet mask, this time 255.255.0.0 because this is class B address.

Click on PC3.

IP address of 201.91.20.1. And this time the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, for this class C address.

Okay, finally let's go back to PC1 and try to ping. Click destop, then command prompt.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tNOYAuw.png)

Okay, looks like PC1 can reach PC2.

How about PC3 ?

Ping 201.191.20.1

Great, PC1 can ping PC3 as well

So, in this lab we looked at how to configure IP address on router interfaces, how to configure interface descriptions, and how to enable interfaces with the 'no shutdown' command. We also configured IP address on PCs in packet tracer and confirmed reachability. Thank you

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 9 - Switch Interfaces

In this video, we'll take a break from IP addresses and take a look at switch interfaces.

When we configured IP addresses, I talked about router interface a little bit. For example, we used the 'show ip interface brief' command to check the Layer 1 and I also talk about how router interfaces are disabled with the 'shutdown' command. This time we'll talk a look at switch interfaces and see how they are different from router interfaces, and also how they are the same.

Specifically, we're going to talk about configuring Layer 1 characteristics of these interfaces, such as speed and duplex. I'll talk about interface speed and duplex.

Speed refers to the data rate in bits per second, such as 10,100 or 1000 megabits per second.

Duplex is something I mentioned briefly in a previuous video, basically it refers to whether a device is able to both send and receive data at the same time.

I'll talk about speed and duplex autonegotiation, which allows two devices to negotiate speed and duplex settings without us having to manually configure them.

I already talked about this in the previous video on configuring router interfaces, but I'll expand upon the topic. Finally, I'll talk about interface counters and errors.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8JeiKwo.png)

Cisco devices keep various counters regarding the traffic that passes through them, such as how many errors have occured, etc.

I'll show you how to find and analyze these statistics, and what kinds of errors there are.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BMAvMb8.png)

Also let me review one point about switches that I mentioned in the very first video in up top is a photo of a Cisco ASR 1000-X router, and under it is a Cisco Catalyst 9200 switch. How about the number of interfaces ? 

The router has 8 SFP interfaces for fiber-optic cables, and then a few RJ45 interfaces for the console port and such.

The switch, on the other hand, has 4 SFP interfaces, plus 48 RJ45 interfaces. This ise because switches are used to connect end hosts to. This catalyst switch might have 48 PCs connected to the RJ45 ports, and then connect to a router. Next let me introduce the network topology. I'll use for this video.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/T5ZVNp1.png)

This is a single LAN, 192.168.1.0/24, with one router R1, two switches , SW1 and SW2 and four PCs, PC1, 2,3 and 4

In a real network with two switches these would be many more end hosts, but just for this demonstration I've attached just these four PCs. SW1 is the device we're going to focus on today, configuring its network interfaces, including f0/1,f0/2,f0/3 and f0/4 which are connected, as well as the remaining interfaces which are not connected at the moment.

Let's go right into  the CLI of SW1.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gDb79Hz.png)

First I use 'enable' to enter privileged exec mode. After entering privileged exec mode, I entered the 'show ip interface brief', using shortcuts. As you can see, the four interfaces which are connected to devices, fastethernet 0/1, 0/2,0/3,0/4 have a status column, which is the Layer 1 status, and a protocol column, which is the Layer 2 status, of UP and UP. Keep in mind I haven't done any configuration on SW1 yet except set the hostname. So already we can see a different between Cisco router and switches What is that ?

Router interfaces are in an administratively disabled state by default, meaning they have the 'shutdown' command applied. They don't have the shutdown command applied, so if you connect them to another device they'll usually be in the up/up state with no configuration required. 

Now, the IP address is inassigned, and it will remain that way because these are layer 2 swithports, they don't need an IP address.

The concept of multilayer switching, where you actually DO assign IP addresses to switches, will be for a future lesson.

For this lesson, don't worry about the IP address column. Now take a look at the other interfaces, keep in mind I'm ignoring the 'VLAN1' virtual. These other interfaces aren't connected to any other devices, so their status is down/down. Keep in mind, down and down is different than administratively down and down. 

Here's the show ip interface brief command on a router, notice administratively down and down, this is because of the 'shutdown command'. Down/Down doesn't mean the interfaces are shutdown, it means they aren't connected . So, to summarize, router interfaces have the shutdown command applied by default, so they will be in the administratively down/down state by default.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kIgA7Ki.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/K9nkrFB.png)

Switch interfaces do not have the shutdown command applied by default, so they will either be in the up/up state, if they are connected to another device, or the down/down state, if not connected. Now, let's look at another useful command to check on switch interfaces. Let's look at each field of the output.

First, the port field simply lists each interface. Next, you might be wondering what this 'name' field is.

I'm not sure why they called it 'name' and not 'description' , but we'll configure description on these interfaces and you'll see that it appears here.

As you can see this is different than the status field of show ip interface brief.

The four connected interfaces show a status of connected, and the unconnected interfaces. There are other possible statuses, we'll cover them as they come up in the course.

Next is the VLAN field.

VLANS will get their own video, basically they can be used to divide LANs into smaller LANS. The only one that does not show a VLAN of 1 is f0/2, which shows trunk. I won't explain trunks now, they'll be covered in the VLAN video. 

Just take note of the fact that the interface connected to the other switch, SW2, is a trunk interface.

Next is the duplex field, which as I mentioned before indicates whether the device is capable of both sending and receiving data at the same time, which is known as full-duplex, or if its not, which is called half-duplex.

Duplex is auto by default on Cisco switches, meaning it will negotiate with the neighboring device and use full-duplex if possible. Notice that all of the unconnected interfaces have a duplex of auto, and the connected interfaces have a duplex of a dash full well, the a stands for auto, and it means that it automatically negotiated a duplex of auto with the neighboring device.

Next is the speed field, which is also auto by default. These are fastethenet interfaces, so they are capable of speeds up to 100 megabuts per second. However, they are also capable of operating at 10 megabits per second. Auto means they are able to negotiate with the device they are connected to and use the fastest speed both devices are capable of [8:52]
