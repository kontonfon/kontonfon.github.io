Những hình ảnh dưới đây là RJ-45 connectors

What is Ethernet ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8JVl1jE.png)

Why we need network protocols/standards ?

If two people are talking to each other, and one only speaks English, and the other only speaks Japanese, there's not going to be a much, or any, communication between them, what they need is some agreed upon system of communicating, like a common language between them, Network protocols serve that purpose for network devices, that's why standards like Ethernets exist. Since we're talking about interfaces and cables in this video, here's a more relevant example 

If you're trying to connect to, for example, a network switch, but the maker of the cable, and the maker of the switch haven't agreed upon size and shape of the connector and port, you won't be able to connect them. That's why there are industry standards that all vendors follow, both in terms of physical standards like connectors and cables, as well as logical standards, like IP, the internet protocol

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XiZOMTc.png)

Now, connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed

These speeds are measured in bits per second

What is a bit ?

Well it's a value represented by either a 0 or a 1

This binary code is how computers work

Youtube, this video, your operating system, all of it just a series of 0s and 1s which your computer interprets

When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in the electrical signal is interpreted by the receiving device as a 0 or a 1. So that's a bit, what's a byte ?

Here we have a series of 8 bits . 8 bits is equal to 1 byte 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/E8waGdS.png)

Now, speed is measured in bits per second

Imagine a byte, 8 bits, of data being sent along a wire, It reaches the neighboring device one bit at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z42CDXt.png)

It doesn't operate one byte at a time like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9f8Z7Hu.png)

So, remember, speed is measured in bits per second, for example kilobits per second, megabits, 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPtHjCm.png)

Data on hard drive for example is measured in bytes, however, so remember a Gigabyte is actually 8 times larger than a gigabit, so let's review some of these measurements.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wxQW2Az.png)

Okay, finally lets talk about some Ethernet standards

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Jhjy8nR.png)

So, here's a table of some IEEE standards for copper Ethernet cables. We'll also take a look a fiber optic cables later in this lesson, but I decided to split them up. We have one for each of the common network cable speeds, 10 megabits per second, ... 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V6YTUdd.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hNzGOkj.png)

UTP Cables 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z2jaJRa.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pObwDj3.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cgteOhz.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aXqxBFO.png)

Full-Duplex transmission means that both devices and send data at the same time, and no problems like collisons will occur because they use separate wires to transmit and receive data. Just like that, both devices send data at the same time and there are no problem. Let's change the device on the left from a PC to a router. Just as a PC usually connects to a switch, a switch usually connects to a router , once again, it's a fastethernet, or 100BASE-T connection, so two pairs are used, 1 and 2, and 3 and 6

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4ec3S9J.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pEzVrAQ.png)

Now, in networks we don't always connect PC to switch, switch to router, what if we want to connect a router to another router ? Or maybe a switch to another switch ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Cbd1b76.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2MVN9qB.png)

While all of that is important information to know, and can cause issues in networks, even in the modern day, the truth is that most modertn networking devices have evolved beyond having to worry about straight-through or crossover cables. That's because newer networking devices include a feature called Auto MDI-X.

Previously, if two switches were connected with a straight-through cable like this, they would be unable to communicate. However, Auto MDI-X allows devices to automatically detect which pins their neighbor is transmitting data on, and then adjust which pins they use to transmit and receive data. They can then exchange data normally. So, unless you're working with network equipment that is quite old, you don't really have to worry about straight-through and crossover cables. But this is good information to be aware of, and it's also good to learn about the concept of auto MDI-X, both for the exam and for real world networking. So we've talked a lot about 10Base-T and 1000Base-T, but what about the higher speed copper ethernet cables ? Remember, I said before that gigabit ethernet and 10 gigabit ethernet, all 8 wires are used. The last two pairs are 4 and 5, and 7 and 8.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iPgWXof.png)

Again, there will be flashcards to help you remember these details. It may seem like a lot to memorize, but if you use the flashcards properly its amazing how easy it is to remember all of these things. Now, here's another big difference between 1000BaseT and 10GBase-T, and 10Base-T and 100-BaseT. In addition to using all four pairs of wires, in 1000base-T and 10Gbase-T, each pair is bidirectional, meaning each pair isn't dedicated specifically to trasmitting data or receiving data. 

Each pair is bidirectional. This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/U4aAAU0.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GUPKrsa.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eNAsz4U.png)

This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds

Okay, we've covered a lot about connections using copper UTP cables 

But there is a newer technology that is superior in many ways. For example, copper UTP wiring can be used for up to 100 meters. That's usually plenty within a LAN, but how about for larger networks ?

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gwif9C5.png)

Look at this Cisco switch here

Here it has 24 ports for RJ45 connectors. These are the ports you would connect a copper UTP cable to. But what about these four interfaces ? 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Y8RfX5K.png)

But what about these four interfaces ?

Take a look at this Cisco router also It only has four RJ45 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Bk7sgZ.png)

The rest of them look like those other four ports on the switch 

In these interface you insert one of these. It's called an SFP transceiver. SFP means small form-factor pluggable. So you insert one of these into the device, but still things aren't complete.

What kind of cable connects to one of these ?

You connect one of these cables. This is a fiber optic cable. Rather than an electrical signal over copper wiring, these cables send light over glass fibers. Notice that there are two connectors on each end. That's because you need one connect to transmit data, and one to receive data, on each end. The copper UTP cables used separate wire pairs within the cable to transmit and receive data. The fiber-optic cables instead use separate cables to transmit and receive, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Jhc6IE.png)

Of course, 'transmit' on the left connects to 'receive' on the right, and 'transmit' on the right connects to 'receive' on the left. Now let's examine the structure of the cable itself.

There are four parts in this diagram, from the center to the outer layer.

Number 1 is the fiberglass core itself

Light is transmitted down this core to transmit data from one device to another

Number 2 is cladding that reflects light,

Number 3 is a protective buffer, which protects the fiberglass from breaking

And number four is the outer jacket of the cable

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PNqvxuD.png)

Now there are a couple main types of fiber-optic cables : Single-mode and multimode 

Let's check out their characteristics and differences 

These are two examples of multimode fiber cables 

The center represents the fiberglass core, and the blue represents the reflective cladding that reflects light down the cable 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TO0A40J.png)

----------------------------------------------------

#### LABS 02

PCs transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6

Switches are the opposite, they transmit data on pins 3 and 6 and receive data on pins 1 and 2

So, we can use a straight-through cable to connect all of these PCs, as well as SRV1, to the switches

Devices of the same type require crossover cables, or else the transmit pins will be connected to the transmit pins, and the receive pins will be connected to the receive pins, which will not allow data to be sent successfully between the devices

Next, let's connect these switches to the routers

Routers are like PCs, they transmit on pins 1 ans 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6 

So let's connect them to the switches with straight-through cables

So, I'll connect R2 to R1 with a crossover cable. R1 and R3 are 3 kilometers apart, so clearly, we will have to use a fiber-optic connection here, although packet tracer doesnt diffentiate between single-mode and multimode, which is appropriate here ? Well, multimode fiber allows distance up to 550 meters, which is more than UTP, but not enough for this connection. Single-mode allows much longer distances, 30 km, 40 km, even more, so in this case we would use single-mode fiber 

Finally, R3 and R4 are separated by 250 meters. That's too long for a UTP cable, but also not so long that we need single-mode fiber. A multimode fiber cable would be sufficient. Let's connect them together... Okay

That's all for this lab 


-----------------------------------------------------------------

#### Day 3. OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite

This third lesson is about two networking models

The first is the OSI Model, and the second is the TCP/IP suite

Note that the TCP/IP suite is a networking model, too, but it's usually referred as the TCP/IP suite, or just TCP/IP

Unless you're familiar with networking, you probably haven't heard of the OSI model.

However, you probably have heard of TCP/IP, or at least the second part of that name, IP, the Internet Protocol, for example you've probably heard of an IP address before. So, what is a networking model ?

Well, networking models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards 

Do you remember what a networking protocol is ?

I talked a bit about Ethernet, and various standards for copper and fiber-optic cables in the Day 2 video

That's an example of a protocol

A networking protocol is a set of rules defining how network devices and software should work, including how they should work together

By the way, protocols refer to logical rules about how devices should communicate, not physical standards.

So, you could visualize it like this

This is a networking model, and it categozies and provides a structure for various networking protocols like this

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6Aowjai.png)

The different colors represent different categories of protocols and standards.

These protocols and standards could define something like the structure and usage of IP addresses, or maybe physical details like electrical voltage used on copper cables when transmitting data.

Let's talk about the OSI model first, and then we'll look at the TCP/IP suite after.

So, what if there were no standard networking models and protocols ?

Here's a few Dell PCs and a few iMacs 

If Dell and Apple each made their own networking model, each with own set of networking protocols, these Dells would be able to communicate with each other, and these iMacs would be able to communicate with each other, but because the Dells and IMacs would speek a different language than each other, with a different set of rules about how to communicate, the Dell wouldn't be to communicate with the imacs

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/grsEBZl.png)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nyjkB0h.png)

This is obviously a problem in modern networks, such as the Internet, where we expect devices from various makers in various countries to be able to communicate with each other. 

The OSI model is one attempt at standardizing network communications 

Although it isn't actually in use today, it has had a big impact on how network engineers think about networking, and we still refer to it today.

OSI stand for 'open system interconnection' model. Open, means that it is an open standard, not a proprietary model developed and used by an invidual company 

It is a conceptual model that categorizes and standardizes the different functions in a network.

It was created by the international organization for standardization, the ISO, in the late 1970s and early 1980s

Network functions are divided into 7 'layers'

From example, look at the bottom layer , layer 1.

It is the physical layer. The standards for cables and interfaces we learned about in the Day 2 video all fit into the physical layer of the OSI model, but there are 6 more layers on top of that to make the network operate properly .

Let's examine each layer one by one, starting at Layer 7, the application layer.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iBLge3s.png)

- This layer is closest to the end user

- The application layer interacts with software applications that have some communication component, such as your web browser, whether that's Brave, Firefox, Chrome, or whatever

- For example HTTP and HTTPs are Layer 7 protocols
(https://www.cisco.com)

Notice https before cisco.com, indicating that https is being used to get this website and view it in the browser

Keep in mind that Layer 7 doesn't include the application itself, like Chrome or Firefox, but rather the protocols that interact with the application, like http or https

- A couple functions of Layer 7 are: identifying communication partners and synchronizing communication

Let me explain how it does this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IN0tXtI.png)

Here I have two OSI model stacks, representing two computer that will communicate with eachother

The software application, maybe a web browser, interacts with Layer 7, the application layer, and wants to send some data to the system on the right.

This data is processed through the OSI stack, each layer adding something to the original 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ruVAGqZ.png)

This is called "encapsulation", because the original data is encapsulated inside this addiional information which is added on 

By the time it reaches the physical layer, it is electrical signals on a wire, and is sent to the neighboring system.

Then, the neighboring system performs the opposite process, the additionals of each layer are stripped off until the data reaches the application layer of the neighboring system 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MlPmFcW.png)

This process is called 'de-encapsulation', as the additional information is removed as the data is processed up the stack 

Both the encapsulation and de-encapsulation processes are examples of 'Adjacent-layer interaction', interaction between the different layers of the OSI model 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cvUlrsr.png)

However, the communication between the appication layers of the two different systems, is called same-layer interaction 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/h6E4bUq.png)

This same-layer interaction between application Layers is what allows the application layer to perform its functions of identifying communication partners, synchronizing communications, etc.

Layer 6 of the OSI is the presentation layer 

Data in the application is in an 'application format', a format that applications understand.

It needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network.

The presentation layer's job is to translate between application and network formats.

One example of a function of the presentation layer is encryption of data as it is sent,  so that only intended recipient can read it and of course decryption as it is received 

The presentation layer also translates between different application-layer formats, to ensure that the data is in a format the receiving host can understand. To summarize, the presentation layer translates data to the appropriate format. That's all you really need to know about the presentation layer.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0ImFLyJ.png)

Layer 5 of the OSI model is the session layer

The session layer controls dialogues, also known as sessions, between communicatings hosts. 

It establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the local application (for example your web browser) and the remote application, for example, Youtube

Youtube's servers  are being used by countless people at evert moment, and there has to be a way to manage all of these sessions. 

That's the purpose of the session layer of the OSI model 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TLJMQJT.png)

So, we've looked at the top 3 layers of the OSI model. From top to bottom, application, presentation, and session.

It's important to know what the functions of these layers are, but actually network engineers don't really work with these layers of the OSI model.

That is the job of application developers. 

Application developers work with the top layers of the OSI model to connect their applications over networks.

Let's return to this diagram

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OBQY7t0.png)

Remember what I said about encapsulation ?

Well, data prepared at the top 3 layers is then sent over to the bottom 4 layers, which actually do the work of sending it over the network. After the top 3 layer hand data over to the bottom 4 layers, the next step before sending is that Layer 4, the transport layer, adds a header in front of the data, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tgMfB1z.png)

So, let's look into the Transport layer a little bit

Layer 4 of the OSI model is the transport layer.

It segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts

To reword that, it breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur

For example, if data wasn't segmented and you were trying to watch a video, if an error occured that prevented the video from reaching your computer, you wouldn't be able to watch the video at all.

However, if the data is segmented into many small units, and only one fails to reach the destination, that's not a big problem. The video might skip for a second, but then will continue on just fine.

Also, the transport layer provides host-to-host communication, also known as end-to-end communication 

This also provide process-to-process communications for applications 

Not let's review 

Data is prepared by the top 3 layers 

a Layer 4 header is added on

Note that at this point in the process, this unit of data plus Layer 4 header is called a segment 

Remember, if the data being sent is large enough, it will actually be segmented into smaller parts, and a Layer 4 header will be added on to each segment.

Next, that segment is passed on to Layer 3 .

and another header is added on to the end, like this 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XyZ5PET.png)

Layer 3 of the OSI model is the Network Layer 

The network layer provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks, for example ,

outside of the local area network, or LAN, which we mentioned briefly in the Day 1 video

Layer 3 provides logical addressing, in the form of IP addresses, something you've probably heard of before 

Layer 3 also provides path selection between source and destination 

Often there are many possible paths which which data can take to reach its destination, especially over a huge network like the Internet 

Layer 3 provides the means of selecting the best path

Routers operate at Layer 3

Remember in Day 1's video I said that routers are used when end hosts need to reach a destination outside of their LAN ?

That's because routers are Layer 3 devices. Let's view the encapsulation process again 

Data is prepared by the upper layers, the transport layer adds a layer 4 header, and this combination of data plus layer 4 header is called a segment, next the network layer adds a layer 3 header, including information like the source and destination IP address, to the segment. 

This combination of data, layer 4 header, and layer 3 header, is called a packet.

Next, the packet is further encapsulated at Layer 2, this time with both a Layer 2 header

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NfiVna0.png)

and a layer 2 trailer 

Layer 2 of the OSI model is the Data Link Layer 

The data link layer provides node-to-node connectively and data transfer 

For example, direct connections between a PC and a switch, or a switch and a router, or a router and a router. Because Layer 2 is adjacent to Layer 1, the physical layer, it also defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium, like copper UTP cables.

Layer 2 also detects, and possibly corrects, errors that occur on the physical layer 

Like layer 3, layer 2 also uses an addressing system, however it separate and different from layer 3 addressing. Finally, swiches operate at Layer 2.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qyf1Z2D.png)

Switches look at the destination Layer 2 address to determine where to send the data, let's look at the encapsulation process once more.

Data is prepared by the application layer 

A layer 4 header is added to the data to make a segment

A layer 3 header is added to the segment to make a packet

Remember, the IP address is included in this Layer 3 header.

Then, a layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer are added to the packet

At this point, the comnination of data, layer 4 header, layer 3 header, layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer is called a frame.

Now, the data is not further encapsulated at Layer 1. This frame is then sent over the connecion, whether it's electrical signals over a wire or wireless signals in the case of wifi, to the neighboring system

Let's look at layer 1 of the OSI model a bit before moving on

Layer 1 of the OSI model is the physical layer

The physical layer defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices

For example, voltages levels, maximum transmission distances, like the maximum cable lengths, mentioned in Day 2's video, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc..

Digital bits are converted into electrical signals, for wired connections, or radio signals, for wireless connections, like Wi-fi as I mentioned before, all of the information in Day 2'video, such as cables and pin layouts, is related to the physical layer of the OSI model. 

Okay, now we've got a complete frame, and that frame will be sent from the local device over this cable, let's say its an ethernet cable,

Once it reaches the remote device, the reverse process of encapsulation, de-encapsulation takes place, the data link layer translates the raw physical data into a complete frame once again


Then the layer 2 header and trailer are removed, leaving the layer 3 packet. 

The layed 3 header is removed, leaving the layer 4 segment.

Finally, the layer 4 header is removed and we are left with original data prepared by the upper layers of the ogirinal device

That's the process of de-encapsulation 

Before moving on, I want to review some terms

So, when an application wants to send data to another system, it interacts with the application layer of the OSI stack and the data is prepared to be sent.

When the layer 4 header is added at the transport layer, what is this combination of data plus . Layer 4 header called ?

It's called a Segment.

Then, the Layer 3 header is added on at the Network layer, remember that includes the IP address.

What's this now called ?

It's called a packet 

Finally, a Layer 2 header and trailer are added 

What's this complete unit called ? It's called a frame

Now, there is one new term that is used to refer to all of these 

These are all called Protocol Data Units or PDUs

For example, segment is the term for a layer 4 PDU, packet is the term for a layer 3 PDU, etc.

By the way, at Layer 1, the physical layer, the name for for the PDU is bit, referring to the bits being transferred on the wire.

So, that's a lot of information 

If you need help remembering the order of the OSI model layers, the flashcards included in the description should be a big help, but here are a couple acronyms too. 

I don't use acronyms to remember things myself, but many people like them, so here are a few examples to help you remember 

The first one goes from layer 7 to layer 1, All People Seem To Need Data Processing.

Here's another one, from layer 1 to layer 7 this time, Please Do Not Teach Students PointLess Acronyms.

If you know any other good ones post them in the comment section !

Now let's move on from the OSI model, to the TCP/IP suite.

Like the OSI model, it is a conceptual model and set of communications protocols, and in TCP/IPs case it is used in the Internet and other networks.

It is known as TCP/IP because those are two of the foundational protocols in the suite.

It was developed by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA, which is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

It has a similar structure to the OSI model, but with fewer layers.
